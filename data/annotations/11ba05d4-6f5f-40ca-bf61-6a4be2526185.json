One of our overarching\nresearch questions throughout the Home to Texas program is about linguistic changes in Texas. As a\npart of this project, a linguistic researcher is asking that interview participants read a brief passage,\nwhich should only take a couple of minutes. It's a short made up story about life in Texas that was\ncreated in the 1980s, and since the linguistic researchers have recorded a few 100 Texans reading it.\nThey use these recordings as samples of people's standard way of speaking as they try to track how\nspeech in Texas varies and changes over time. Would you be willing to read a passage out loud?"}]}],"tags":[{"category":"Speaker","tag":"Interviewer"}],"uuid":"986e45bd-e922-4196-a587-b4efb455cf40"},{"start_time":2083,"end_time":2084,"annotation":[{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":"Sure."}]}],"tags":[{"category":"Speaker","tag":"Participant"}],"uuid":"7aaf90f0-57ec-4061-accf-91b207cb2e5d"},{"start_time":2085,"end_time":2095,"annotation":[{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":"Great.

I was Born in Titus County, and when I was five, we moved to a\nfarm near White House, which is south east of Tyler. I like growing up in the country. When my chores\nwere done, I'd ride my horse, climb trees or hike down to the creek to fish or swim. One time we tied a\nrope to a limb of a cypress tree and would swing out wide over the swimming hole and drop into the\nwater. I pretend to be Tarzan swinging on a vine. The spring. I'd fly in the spring at fly kites and on\nsummer nights we'd watch fireflies, but we call them lightning bugs. Every once in a while we'd have\nfights with corn cobs or pine cones. In the winter we'd build a fire in the fireplace and pop popcorn and\nroast peanuts and pecans. I guess I was a live wire. When I was 19 I went to work in Dallas at a\nFirestone Firestone Tire store. I didn't like city life. And for a long time I go home every chance I got.\nmama would always cook my favorite foods. fried okra, Hoppin'John, that's rice and black eyed peas and pecan pie. We had lots of good times, but going home is not the same now. After daddy and mom after daddy died and mom sold the farm and moved to Tyler. I'd rather be living on a farm right now instead of here in the city. But my wife and kids don't understand me when I gripe about city life and\ntalk about moving to the country. My oldest child says Daddy, that's crazy. I just die if I had to live on a\nfarm. I almost cried the first time she said that. I know Texas is changing, but I try to make sure we\ndon't lose touch with our roots. While we may live in a city, I want my kids to have a good feeling for the\nland. Have a sense of place and take pride in being Texans. If they lose our ties to the land, the price of\nprogress is too high."}]}],"tags":[{"category":"Speaker","tag":"Participant"}],"uuid":"d6fd17a4-79cc-4ec5-9f67-bac4e7b6bb33"},{"start_time":2227,"end_time":2243,"annotation":[{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":"Thank you for contributing your voice to the collection.
