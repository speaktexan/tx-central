As part of\nthis project, a linguistic researcher is asking that interview participants read a brief passage, which\nwould only take a couple of minutes. It's a short made up story about life in Texas that was created in\nthe 1980s. And since then, linguistic researchers have recorded a few hundred Texans reading it. They\nuse these recordings as samples of people standard way of speaking as they try to track how speech in\nTexas varies and changes over time. Would you be willing to read a brief passage on that?"

When my chores were done, I'd ride my horse, climb trees or hike down to the creek to fish or\nswim. One time we tied a rope to a limb of a cypress tree, and we'd swing out wide over the swimming\nhole and drop into the water. I pretend to be Tarzan swinging on a vine. In the spring I'd fly kites and on\nsummer nights we catch fireflies, but we called them lightning bugs. Once in a while we'd have fights\nwith corn cobs or pine cones. In the winter we [OUTSIDE DOOR OPENS] build fire in the fireplace and\npop popcorn and roast peanuts and pecans. [OUTSIDE INAUDIBLE TALKING] I guess I was a live\nwire. When I was 19 I went to work in Dallas at a Firestone Tire store. I didn't like city life and for a long\ntime I go home every chance I got. [OUTSIDE INAUDIBLE TALKING] Mama would always cook my\nfavorite foods. Fried okra, [OUTSIDE INAUDIBLE TALKING] hoppin john, that's rice and black-eyed\npeas, and pecan pie.

[OUTSIDE INAUDIBLE TALKING] My oldest child says, Daddy, that's crazy. I'd\njust died if I had to live on a farm. I almost cried the first time she said that. [OUTSIDE INAUDIBLE\nTALKING] I know Texas is- is changing. [OUTSIDE INAUDIBLE TALKING] But I've tried to make sure\nwe don't lose touch with our roots.
