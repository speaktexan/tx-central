And that includes administrators. And that includes the\nfaculty, and that includes the student body uh. That was all and you had to get to know your audience,\nyou had to get to know, I had to know something about my principal {hit the table}, I had to know\nsomething {hit the table} about the faculty. And then I had to be able to get to know the kids. And when\nyou and, you build those relationships with them. And I was fortunate because some kids I had for four\nyears, how many years I have you, two years {interviewer said mhm}. So we build relationships, and\nmy president, and same thing out here, he put a plan together, and you work that plan. And you stay\nwith that plan, and you can tweak it. But at the end of the day, you're still working towards that same\ncommon goal. You always want {hadn hit the table} to have a goal, but don't set it so high that you can't\nattain it. And that's what I tell you about college. Don't set your goals so high, you can't get it. be\nchallenged. Press yourself. Be willing to accept setbacks, not failures, people who fail are the ones who\ndon't try again, but you're gonna have setbacks, you're gonna have days and you're gonna go, what am\nI doing here, or this guy's a nut, this professors is a nut, but you're gonna find that in a workplace learning to deal with people who I didn't care for, but they didn't care for me. But we had a common\ngoal {interviewee moved in chair}. And that was to educate, educate people out here cows, they don't\nargue with me. They just don't go where I want them to go sometimes, or they're crap on you, or they'll\nkick you. But don't get so close to him, he kicked. So it's all runs the same deal. It's a lot more pleasant\n{interviewee moved in chair}. out here. I love teaching {intervewer name} for 23 years. But that last one\nwas bad after COVID {interviewer said Yea} That got me. I couldn't do that technology stuff. I made a\ndeal with {high school principle}, when everybody was called back to school Interviewer said mhm}, and\nsome of them didn't come back. I said, Hey, what you do, I'll make you deal what is it? I said, you get all\nthose online kids out of my room. And let me I don't care. You gave me 24 fellows. In every class, I'll\ntake them. And I and I said, let me work with them live and in person. And I'll give you my retirement in\nthe school year. He goes, I'll get all the online kids {interviewee moved in chair} out of your room,\nbecause that wasn't my wellness And, and he said, he said, but I don't want you to retire. I said, Okay,\nlet me rephrase {interviewee moved in chair} that. I'm going to retire. And I would appreciate it if I could\ngo out to spring on a pot with enjoyment, enjoying it, and to enjoy the last semester {interviewee tap the\ntable} I'm here, after all these years have given of giving, get up get the online people out of my room.\nAnd he did.
