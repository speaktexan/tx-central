Um, then with the, uh, Chamber of\nCommerce, when- when, things started happening in [CENTRAL TEXAS REGION'S CITY NAME],\n[COMMUNITY NAME] is very close to [CENTRAL TEXAS REGION'S CITY NAME]. So when IRS, the\nUS government, uh, Internal Revenue Service came to [CENTRAL TEXAS REGION'S CITY NAME],\nsome women started working in [CENTRAL TEXAS REGION'S CITY NAME], the [TEXAS\nUNIVERSITY NAME], they would go there to work. And that was when it started evolving into two\nfamilies to support, um, the, um the family. And then when IBM, uh, came on [CENTRAL TEXAS\nREGION'S CITY AREA LOCATION], that was another significant boost for [COMMUNITY NAME]\nbecause it was located on the north side of [CENTRAL TEXAS REGION'S CITY NAME], [\nCONSTRUCTION NOISE] And, uh, uh again, that was a location that, uh, many of the, the women\nwent to work. Uh, then the chamber kind of ,uh, transformed in recent years, probably about, uh, a\ndecade ago, uh, that, uh, live here, work here. Okay, so instead of being a commuter, uh, city, where\npeople would go someplace to work, the, the thought process was to develop jobs live here, work here,\nplay here. And so that's what, uh, it has transformed into, uh, also. Uh, uh, even as much as a grocery\nstore. Uh, I can remember where every new HEB was one was at [COMMUNITY SHOPPING\nCENTER], okay,[CENTRAL REGION CITY COMMUNITY CENTER], then [ANOTHER NEIGHBORING\nCITY] got an HEB and, uh, then even as far out of [CENTRAL COMMUNITY REGION CITY NAME]\nstart growing out to [CENTRAL TEXAS REGION'S CITY AREA LOCATION] was the safe way.

And of course, uh, uh Walmart was the, uh on, [COMMUNITY AREA LOCATION] was kind of the, um, magnet that then transformed where we started getting other, uh corporate, um, entities\nlike, you know, eventually we would get Target, Home Depot, Best Buy and those things.

As a school board trustee that goes beyond just the city\nbecause the school district is like 96 square miles, as opposed to the city, which itself, the city has\n80,000.

Okay, so, uh, trying to be a listen to the stakeholders, whether their parents or their business people or thier\nthe teachers, the workforce, uh, what-what's happening, who's coming to town? uh, that's important, I\nthink, for the school to know that. But, uh, uh, again, from the workforce thing, it's-it's changing\nsignificantly. Because, again, as I, uh, said, with the volunteers, another component was the school\nwas the core, everybody went to school activities. That's how [COMMUNITY NAME]'s name was\npromoted throughout the state and our students going nationally to competitions, they would know\nwhere [COMMUNITY NAME] is, okay. Now, uh, and we used to be a fast growth district, you know,\nfrom one high school to four high schools,uh, we now have 35, 36 campuses.

And so that is again, separating\ncommunity, because when we were the only district, people within their neighborhoods would go to that\nschool, be in the PTO, go to the Little League games, um, you know, etc. And know one another and\ndo whatever. And when you have the charter schools are, uh, there's not that many private schools,\nthere's a few, but the homeschooling then that house, you have a different groups and they don't\ninterconnect, so that we're losing that unity. And again, one of the strengths of our community has\nbeen, uh, a good school system academically and with extracurricular activities, because we've always\npromoted, uh, excellence in whatever we do. So our students, whether they're in debate are if they are\nin athletics, or fine arts span, uh, theater of whatever they're doing, even from elementary school to\nspelling bee, you know, they do and they excel, and we need to, uh, amplify that and, uh, let our\ncommunity know that good things are happening."}]}],"tags":[{"category":"Speaker","tag":"Participant"}],"uuid":"13cf8dc7-6134-4737-9b23-1c515a74fc6c"},{"start_time":706,"end_time":872,"annotation":[{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":"Mhmm, Absolutely.
