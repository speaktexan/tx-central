But my wife and kids don't understand me when I gripe about city life and talk about moving to the country, my oldest child says, daddy, that's crazy. I'd just die if I had to live on a farm. I almost cried the first time she said that. I know Texas is changing, but I try to make sure we don't lose touch with our roots while we may live in a city. I want my kids to have a good feeling for the land, have a sense of place, and take pride in being Texans. If they lose our ties to the land, the price of progress is too high.  "
