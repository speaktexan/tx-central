And, um, we're in the process of building a new, um, medical school, that medical school just started this year as part of the UT System. So that's going to add additional, um, emphasis on growth in this area, particularly in the health, health care area. But, uh, we're, we're very fortunate. Um, we have oil and gas in this area, we have real estate, we have quite a bit of manufacturing. Um, we have a tourist industry and a large service industry. So we're a pretty diversified economy.

So ours was just, just a little bit different level. So, uh, that's probably it. Um, because we are so close to, uh, the metropolitan areas sometimes we're overshadowed, and stuff in the transportation areas. So for instance, we have a small to medium sized airport. But we can't attract certain airlines to the airport, because we're within so close to the [NORTH TEXAS REGION COMMUNITY NAME] or [LOUISIANA CITY NAME] areas, so that, that's not something we can really change.

So, uh, in the late 80s, when the oil industry and real estate industry tanked, uh, or went down so bad, a lot of organizations fail, including banks. And so I woke up one day, and I was without a job. And, uh, uh, the bank sent me through an outsourcing program in Dallas, and they did, you know, personality testing, like a lot of places do. And so the test came back, which I've never really taken very seriously and said, you know, the number one thing you got to do is go to work at a chamber of commerce and number two was be a preacher. And I was like, I just almost laughed at it. But I came back because I was a volunteer. I actually was the Vice President of the Chamber as a volunteer then, and, and I told my, um, the head of it, the chamber, at that time, I said, look at my test. Isn't that funny? In the meantime, I went to work for someone else. And then about six months later, the chamber called me and said, we remember that testing, we have a job opening. Would you come to work for us? And I said, well, it's a nonprofit. That's not a real job. That's, that's what I thought then. But I don't really like the job I'm doing right now, so I'll come do that till I find a real job. So I like telling people 35 years later, I'm still looking for that real job [LAUGHS]. Not really. That's, that's how I got to be in this industry. "

And they did not have irrigation systems then, they just had water spigots. And so one of my chores was to take hoses and, uh, watering devices and water the cemeteries where our plots were. And it was all, of course, it was always in the heat of the summer so I hated that because it was always so hot, dragging the hoses around. And we had quite a few plots in the cemetery [CHUCKLES]. At that time, it was up to everybody to water their own parts of the cemetery. That doesn't exist anymore. So I doubt that anybody has that chore because most cemeteries are irrigated now [LAUGHS]. And they have sprinklers that come on and water them, but that was, that was a chore I had that I bet not many people have had in the past [LAUGHS]. "

It's a short made up story about life in Texas that was created in the 1980s.

I was born in Titus County, and when, and when I was five, we moved to a farm near Whitehouse, which is southeast of Tyler. I liked growing up in the country. When my chores were done, I'd ride my horse, climb trees, or hike down to the creek to fish or swim. One time we tied a rope to a limb of a cypress tree, and we'd swing out wide over the swimming hole and drop into the water. I'd pretend to be Tarzan swinging on a vine. And in the spring I'd fly kites, and on summer nights we'd catch fireflies—but we called them \"lightening bugs.” Once in a while, we'd have fights with corn cobs or pinecones. In the winter we'd build a fire in the fireplace and pop popcorn and roast peanuts and pecans. I guess that was a live wire. When I was nineteen, I went to work in Dallas at a Firestone tire store. I didn't like city life, and for a long time I'd go home every chance I got. Mama would always cook my favorite foods: fried okra, Hoppin' John—that's rice with black-eyed peas—and pecan pie. We had lots of good times, but going home is not the same now. After Daddy died, Mama sold the farm and moved to Tyler. I'd rather be living on a farm right now instead of here in the city, and my, but my wife and kids don't understand me when I gripe about the city life and talk about moving to the country. My oldest child says, \"Daddy, that's crazy. I'd just die if I had to live on a farm.\" I almost cried the first time she said that. I know Texas is changing, but I try to make sure we don't lose touch with our roots. While we may live in a city, I want my kids to have a good feeling for all the land, and have a, have a sense of place, and take pride in long, pride in being Texans. If they lose our lives, if we lose our ties to the land, the price of progress is too high. Is that the end? "
