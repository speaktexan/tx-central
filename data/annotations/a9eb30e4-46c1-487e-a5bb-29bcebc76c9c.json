And so in that case, it's it's harder to find, uh, how the work community interacts with the local community. Even though, uh, I guess from a corporate standpoint, regardless of what city the company is, in that that they want to keep a presence uh or a connection to the community to some degree. Um, a lot of that is either through uh corporate sponsorship, um, whether it's of uh, one of the um, one of the uhh, sponsorship of like uhh, well one case is the [BASEBALL STADIUM NAME] in [DIFFERENT CENTRAL TEXAS REGION COMMUNITY NAME] in which [COMPANY NAME] uh sponsors, uh, the [CENTRAL TEXAS REGION BASEBALL TEAM NAME]. There are other areas where either individuals, well, individuals of the company, uh have sponsored uh different things [COMMUNITY HOSPITAL NAME] or uh, um, [FORMER COMPANY EMPLOYEE NAME] uh has his name on one of the, uh, play, um, play theatres, and he was ex, he he was formerly at [COMPANY NAME].

A third reason may have also been the popularity of MTV for which MTV was still a full medium just for music. Um, so, I think there might have been both the technology and socio-business way that things put an emphasis on on music through the 80's.

If you have the time, I just have one last request for you before we conclude our interview. One of the overarching research questions about the Home to Texas pro program is about linguistic changes in Texas. As part of this program, a linguistic researcher is asking that interview participants read a brief passage, which should only take a couple of minutes. It's a short made up story about life in Texas that was created in the 1980s and since then, linguistic researchers have recorded a few 100 Texans reading it. They use these recordings as samples of people standard way of speaking as they try to track how speech in Texas varies and changes over time. Would you be willing to read a brief passage out loud?"

              "text": "Okay. I've lived in Texas all my life. I was born in Titus County. And when I was five, we moved to a farm near White House, which is south east of Tyler. I liked growing up in the country. When my chores were done, I'd ride my horse, climb trees and hike down to the creek to fish or swim. One time we tied a rope to a limb of a cypress tree, and we swing out wide over the swimming hole and drop into the water. I pretended to be Tarzan swinging on a vine. In the spring I'd fly kites and on the summer nights we'd catch fireflies, but we'd call them lightning bugs. Once in a while we'd have [STUTTER] fights with corn cobs or pine cones. In the winter, we'd build a fire in the fireplace and pop popcorn and roast peanuts and pecans. I guess I was a Livewire. When I was 19, I went to work in Dallas at the Firestone Tire store. I didn't like city life, and for a long time I'd go home every chance I got. Mama would always cook my favorite foods, [INAUDIBLE NAME OF FOOD], Hoppin' John, that's rice and black eyed peas, and pecan pie. We had lots of good times, but [STUTTER] but going home is not the same now. After daddy died, Mama sold the farm and move to Tyler. I'd rather be living on a farm right now instead of here in the city, but my wife and kids don't understand me when I gripe about city life and talk about moving to the country. My oldest child says \"Daddy, that's crazy, I'd just die if I had to live on a farm.\" I almost cried the first time she said that. I know Texas is changing, but I try to make sure we don't lose touch with our roots. While we may live in the city, I want my kids to have a good feeling for the land, have a sense of place, and take pride in being Texans. If they lose our ties to the land, the price of progress is too high. Thank you for contributing your voice to the collection. And thank you much for [INAUDIBLE], [CHUCKLE], think you're supposed to read that to me."
