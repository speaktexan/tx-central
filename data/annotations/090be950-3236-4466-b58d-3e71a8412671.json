One of the\noverarching research questions is about linguistic changes in Texas and as a part of this project, uh, a\nlinguistic researchers asking that the participants in this interview read a brief passage. Just takes a\ncouple minutes. It's a short made up story about life in Texas that was created the 1980s and since\nthen, linguistic researchers have been recording a few hundreds Texans reading it. They use these\nrecordings as samples of people's standard way of speaking as they try to track how speech in Texas\nvaries and changes over time. Would you be willing to read a brief passage out loud?"

I liked growing up in the country. When my choices were\ndone. I mean, when my chores were done, I'd ride my horse, climb trees, or hike down the creek to fish\nand swim. One time we tried to rope, um, to a limb of a cypress tree, and we'd swing out over the\nswimming hole and drop into the water. I'd pretend to be Tarzan swinging on the vine. In the spring, I'd\nfly kites and on summer nights, we'd watch fireflies, but we call them lightning bugs. While, uh, once in\na while. [TONGUE SMACKS] We'd have fights with corn cobs and pine cones. In the winter we'd build\na fire in the fireplace and pop popcorn and roast peanuts and pecans. I guess I was a live wire. When I\nwas 19 I went to work in Dallas at Firestone Tire store. I didn't like li- uh, city life and for a long time I'd\ngo home every chance I got. [LAUGHS] Mama would always cook my favorite foods. Fried okra, hoppin\njohn, that's the rice and black eyed peas, and pecan pie. We had lots of good times, but going home is\nnot the same now. After daddy died, Mama sold the farm and moved to Tyler. I'd rather be living on the\nfarm right now instead of here in the city, but my wife and kids don't understand me when I gripe about\ncity life [LAUGHS] and talk about moving to the country. My oldest child says \"Daddy, you're crazy,\" or\n\"that's crazy. I just die if I had to live on a farm.\" [CLEARS THROAT] I almost cried the first time she\nsaid that. I know Texas is changing, but I try to make sure it doesn't lose touch with its roots or with our\nroots. While we may live in the city, I want my kids to have a good feeling for the land, [SNIFFLES]\nmmm, have a sense of place and take pride of being Texans. If they lose their ties to the land, the price\nof progress is too high."
