It's a short made up story about life in Texas that was created in\nthe 1980s. And since then, linguistic researchers have recorded a few hundred Texans reading it. They\nuse these recordings as samples of people standard way of speaking as they try to track how speech in\nTexas varies and changes over time. Would you be willing to read a brief passage on that?"

When my chores were done, I'd ride my horse, climb trees or hike down to the creek to fish or\nswim. One time we tied a rope to a limb of a cypress tree, and we'd swing out wide over the swimming\nhole and drop into the water. I pretend to be Tarzan swinging on a vine. In the spring I'd fly kites and on\nsummer nights we catch fireflies, but we called them lightning bugs. Once in a while we'd have fights\nwith corn cobs or pine cones. In the winter we [OUTSIDE DOOR OPENS] build fire in the fireplace and\npop popcorn and roast peanuts and pecans. [OUTSIDE INAUDIBLE TALKING] I guess I was a live\nwire.
