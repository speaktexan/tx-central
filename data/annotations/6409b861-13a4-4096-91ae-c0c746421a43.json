I did my student teaching here in [COMMUNITY NAME], in second\ngrade, and then I got married and started having children, and I wanted to be home with my kids. So I\ndid not go to work. I stayed home for five years. And then when I decided to go to work, there was a job\nopening at the high school, and not in second grade. So I took the test, um to be certified to teach\nEnglish. And I taught English for a year. And the grading at night was just extremely time consuming\nwith little children. And so then I went back and took the test to be a home economics teacher. And I did\nthat for a couple of years. And I enjoyed that. But um we did a lot of competitions, which also pulled me\naway from my family. And um so I was just having lunch one day with a coach and talking about how\noverwhelming all the um competitions and, and classroom grading and that kind of thing was for me at\nthat point in my life with young kids. And he said, I think you should be a librarian. I think it's the best\njob in the school. And I literally said, Do you even have to have a certification to be a librarian? And he\nsaid, Yeah, I think you have to have your master's degree. So when I got back to school, after lunch, I\ncalled TEA, and they um had this window, this one year window, where you could test out um to get\ncertified to be a librarian. So I signed up that day for the test, and took it, you know, a few weeks later,\nand got my certification. And the librarian at the time, had been there for 120 years, and had no plan on\nretiring. So I continued to teach home economics the rest of that year. And then she changed her mind\nfor some reason at the end of the year and decided she wasn't going to come back. So I uh took that\njob.

I spend a lot of time\nresearching books, especially new books that are coming out. So like in May, I did inventory in the\nlibrary And then I researched, I have an order ready for September when we get our budget. So that's\npretty time consuming. um And I try to choose the books by how many awards they've won. But I also\nhave to look deeper because it's a fairly conservative community. And so I I try to keep that in mind.\nAlso, as I'm doing book orders. um And, and I try to uh break down, you know, our demographics and\nand what we need. For instance, I probably had five books that were books that were in Spanish um\nfive years ago. And now I probably have 200, because we have kids that are bilingual that are, you\nknow, more and more coming to our school. So uh I try to meet the needs of all the kids. um So, so\nthat's part of my job. That's part of my day, I also do um coach UIL during the day. And I spend a lot of\nmy time preparing for that. um Picking pieces for prose and poetry. um And just setting the time aside\ntime to find things that I feel like will benefit for kids for all the different events that I teach. um That's\nprobably takes up as much of my time as doing library work, because it's I teach eight different events.\nAnd so um just finding the right program, for some of them like spelling, it took a couple of years to find\nthe program that I thought would best benefit the kids. um So there's uh so that that takes up part of my\nday. Also, I also do odd jobs, like I do copies for teachers that are in a bind, I I've done lesson plans for\nour home economics and English teachers when we had didn't have um permanent teachers, and we\nwere doing long term sets, they've asked me to do lesson plans. um I've also done lesson plans for a\nhistory class for one semester. um And when I was teaching I, I did a a distance learning German\nclass, which was all uh technology related stuff. So they have also added technology in as part of my\num job description. um I'm I'm are since last year, we have not had four um certified librarians, we've\nhad subs in the librarian positions, and paraprofessionals. And so I'm also in charge of doing all the\nbook ordering for those uh paraprofessionals while they're there. um And I think this is also becoming\ngoing to be my part of my permanent job because I think that's the decision the school board is going\nwith is to have paras in those positions. So I order for them. um I I meet with all of the librarians every\ntwo months. And we go over our goals and what what we need to do to make the library improve the\nlibrary, um which usually includes weeding the library this year, we weeded 40 boxes out of the library.\num That's not typical, but that just is what happened this year. um I've also when others um teachers\nare going back to school to be librarians I have been their supervisor so that they can get their\ncertification. And that requires 180 hours of doing service and monitored service and, and writing\nwriting up, you know what all they do and need to do and that kind of thing. So um I mean, it's hard to\nsay, you know, really what I do [CHUCKLES] in a day because it does change so much. um There's a\nlot of times that there are classes in the library, and and I try to meet their nee needs. My job has\nchanged so much through the years. um You know, when I first started we would do I would work with\nthe English teachers. And we would they would come to the library once a week and we would do a\nlesson together and we would actually co teach and so like if I was going to do a lesson on um\nbibliographies or our lesson on citation, let's say citation, I would take it at that time we had newspapers, I would take a newspaper and lay it out and we would teach how to do a citation at that\nstation. And then we would do a citation on a reference book a citation on fiction a citation on\nnonfiction, and we would just go through rotate through stations, and I would go with the, a the teacher\nwould take some of the stations, I would take the others, and we would just do a rotation of teaching\nthat. Now kids don't even probably do lessons on citations, because they just plug it in. And the\ncomputer does it for him. So um our that role has changed through the years, I do almost no t\ncoteaching anymore. um So I would say primarily, my job right now is the all the fun stuff, which is\nfinding great books and getting kids to read be interested in reading great books."}]}],"tags":[{"category":"Speaker","tag":"Participant"}],"uuid":"8d704f1d-43d3-43da-b6dc-0b268b02c198"},{"start_time":1243,"end_time":1250,"annotation":[{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":"So what does it mean to be a librarian and UIL coach, all the things you do in this community?"}]}],"tags":[{"category":"Speaker","tag":"Interviewer"}],"uuid":"d533efe2-e274-43ca-98a5-585eb1f09efa"},{"start_time":1251,"end_time":1320,"annotation":[{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":"Um, well, I mean, I hope that, you know, I love my job.

In the spring I'd fly kites and on summer nights we'd catch\nfireflies we called them lightning bugs.
