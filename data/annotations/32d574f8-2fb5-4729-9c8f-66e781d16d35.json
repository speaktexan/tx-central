I remember, in the 80s, when I was a teenager, I\nmean, I didn't, I didn't understand the broader context of what was going on in California and other\nplaces. But I remember what's happening here. And I look back, and I can kind of correlate, you know,\nconnect the dots, what was happening, and, uh, it's not limited here, a little bit there. And\n[COMMUNITY NAME] shares, shares traits with other big cities.

Um, I never got into country\nmusic or rap. Um, I think when I was very young, I was, I was subjected to being trapped in the vehicle\nwith my parents, they love to listen to their country music, and smoke a lot of cigarettes. So I'd be\ntrapped in a car with cigarette smoke and country music. So that might have made me biased against\ncountry music, I don't know. But in the 90s definitely electronica took off. John Digweed made his\ndebut, uh, I guess show in 94. Uh, a lot of other artists, some of them started out in like the late 80s like\nMobie. Also, some some some rock I liked some heavy metal, Iron, uh, Iron Maiden well they're more\nat 80s, mostly electronic."

It's a short made up story about life in Texas that was created in the 1980s. And since the\nlinguistics researchers have recorded a few 100 Texans reading it they use these recordings as\nsamples of people's standard way of speaking as they try to track how speech in Texas varies and\nchanges over time.

When my chores were done. I ride\nmy horse, climb trees, or hike down the creek to fish or swim. One time when we tie a rope to a limb of\na cypress tree and we swing out wide over the swimming hole and drop it into the water. I pretend to be\nTarzan swing on a vine. In the spring, I'd fly kites and on summer nights we'd catch fireflies but we call\nthem lightning bugs. Once in a while we'd have fights with the corn, with corn cobs or pine cones. In the\nwinter we'd build a fire in the fireplace and popcorn and roast peanuts and pecans. I guess I was a live\nwire. When I was 19 I went to work in Dallas at a Firestone Tire store. I didn't like city life and for a long\ntime I'd go home every chance I got. Mama would always cook my favorite foods: fried okra. hoppin\njohn, that's rice and black eyed peas, and pecan pie. We had a lot of good times, but going home, it's\nnot the same now, after daddy died, mom's sold the farm and moved to Tyler. [CLAP] I'd rather be\nliving on a farm right now, instead of here in the city. But my wife and kids don't understand me when I\ngripe about city life and talking about moving to the country. My oldest child says, Daddy, that's crazy.\nI'd just die if I had to live on a farm. I almost cried the first time she said that. I know Texas is changing.\nBut I try to make sure we don't lose touch with our roots. While we may live in a city, I want my kids to\nhave a good feeling of the land. Have a sense of place and take pride to be in Texas. If they lose our\nties to the land, the price of progress is too high. Yeah, I don't have a normal, uh, Texas accent.\n[BACKGROUND NOISE] It's all good. I grew up in the city, city boy."
