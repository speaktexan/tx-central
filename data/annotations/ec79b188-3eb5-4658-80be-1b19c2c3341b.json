And that was\nnot unusual or, um, odd. It just was. And to me, I think that's an incredible, um, blessing of, or one of the great benefits of living in, in [COMMUNITY NAME], specifically. Um, I think the cost of living in [COMMUNITY NAME] has been lower. Now, that comes with some negative sides related to the fact\nthat I think that there's some poverty issues and other things that need- that are being addressed and\nneed to be addressed. So there's the other side of the coin of lower cost of living, um, the other side of\nthat, but I do think it has a lower cost of living. And, um, and I think that's attractive, um, to families who\nare coming here. I think that it, um... I think the town draws families, maybe more so than it even draws,\num, kind of a single population.

And as I dug into that information a little bit what I realized is that in other\nmajor metropolitan areas, oftentimes they're independent cities within that city, so you call it the Dallas\nmetroplex, but really, it's Garland or Mesquite, or you know, all these separate towns. Or in New York\nCity would be The Bronx or Brooklyn or Manhattan specific, those are boroughs, not so much cities. But\n- [PERSON'S NAME], just one sec, I'll be with you - But in [COMMUNITY NAME], it's- it's one city for\nthe most part. And so I think that's why, whereas those - if this makes sense - that, um, Oakland would\nbe considered separate from San Francisco, two different cities, but [COMMUNITY NAME] is one large\nfootprint of one singular city. So there's, um. So that's why I think they hit that data point as being the\nmost, um, economically segregated country - uh, city, major city in the country. I think that's a real\nnegative of our community that there is, um, you can only drive 15 minutes within the same city limits\nand have very different economic experiences. And that's really, I think you see it in, um, free lunch\nprograms, etc. in the school setting. I mean, that would be a place where you would notice it,\nspecifically, the percentage of kids just 10 minutes apart, um. Who the percentage of kids that might be\nin, uh, qualifying for free and reduced lunch on a school campus and just 10 minutes away, or maybe\n15... maybe that's 98%? And over here, just three, and it's just 10, 12 minutes, and... in the same city\nlimits. So. I think that's a negative. For sure. That's interesting. I hadn't heard about that statistic\nbefore. Yeah, might be worth looking into. Yeah, I mean, I'm speaking a little bit about what I a little bit\nknow."

And oftentimes what I say is when\nyou've lived in the same spot for 50, now four years, and actually, I've lived in the same property since I\nwas 13.

And when you do that, um, the world\nstarts circling around you a little bit, right? Um, it- it's not so much that they're circling around me\nbecause of me, um. It's just when you're static, you, um... the connections begin to happen, um. And... I\nthink also being involved in this educational movement that I'm a part of here at this school, this\nparticular kind of K-12 school as well as the ministry I was involved with, um, it's Young Life, in\n[COMMUNITY NAME], there are a lot of relational connections as well, between those - those\ncommunities tend to be sort of small, and, um - small and big.

And we had a couple friends that we trusted and loved and respected who had began to talk about this kind of school. And it resonated the kind of school it was, while it was a new concept in terms- in terms of title, it very much resonated with the kind of education my parents sort of supplemented, while I went to the public school in [COMMUNITY\nNAME]. And so it sounded very attractive and we came here as parents and then after a number of\nyears was asked if I would consider stepping into an employment role in the classroom. And then after\nthat, it's just been meeting needs as they come up. Um, as the- as the school has needed me to do\ndifferent things.

But there's all- in a private environment, there's\nalways a balance between tuition and budget. And so, it's not spreading taxable dollars across, you\nknow, lots of people. And again, I'm not saying that in a public setting, that's not a same stress, I think it\nis because it's many more buildings and many more problems with more funders. But, um, it's the same\npublic or private, that... limited resources. So limited resources is a challenge. Having said that, I know\nthat I'm in a place where,um, it's not as limited as other places. And so, but just being mindful of,\nthere's only this many dollars and everybody wants something bigger or better or fixed or new or\ncleaned, or, I got an email this morning that, uh - we just painted a room and the teacher said, \"It looks\nfantastic. The outside of the door is great, but is the inside of the door getting done?\" And nobody was\nbeing rude or ugly. But it's that like, \"oh, well, not yet. Sorry.\" Um, so I think that's a challenge. I think\nalso, um, there's many, many opinions in a school setting, um, about what's the most important thing,\num, and you've got all the employees, you've got your supervisors, the people who you work with, but\nthen you also have hundreds of parents who have opinions.

              "text": "Here we go. I've lived in Texas all my life. I was born in Titus County. And when I was five, we moved to a farm near White House which is southeast of Tyler. I liked growing up in the country. When my chores were done, I'd ride my horse, climb trees, or hike down to the creek to fish or swim. One time we tied a rope to a limb of a cypress tree and would swing out wide over the swimming hole and drop into the water. I'd pretend to be Tarzan swinging on a vine. In the spring I'd fly kites and on summer nights we'd catch fireflies, but we called them lightning bugs. Once in a while we'd have fights with corncobs or pine cones. In the winter we would build a fire in the fireplace and pop popcorn and roast peanuts and pecans. I guess I was a live wire. When I was 19 I went to work in Dallas at a Firestone Tire store. I didn't like city life, and for a long time I'd go home every chance I got. Mama would always cook my favorite foods: fried okra, hopping John - that's rice and black eyed peas - and pecan pie. We had lots of good times, but going home is not the same now. After Daddy died, Mama sold the farm and moved to Tyler. I'd rather be living on a farm right now instead of here in the city, but my wife and kids don't understand me when I gripe about city life and talk about moving to the country. My oldest child says, \"Daddy, that's crazy. I'd just die if I had to live on a farm.\" I almost cried the first time she said that. I know Texas is changing, but I try to make sure we don't lose touch with our roots. While we may live in a city, I want my kids to have a good feeling about the land, have a sense of place and take pride in being Texans. If they lose our ties to the land, the price of progress is too high."
