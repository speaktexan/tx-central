I just have one last request for you before we conclude our interview. One of the overarching research questions through the Home to Texas program is about linguistic changes in Texas [ADJUSTS PHONE]. As a part of this project, a linguistic re-researcher is asking the interview [HESITATES] participants to read a brief passage, which should only take about a couple of minutes. It's a short made up story about how life in Texas-that was created in the 1980s. And since then, linguistic researchers have recorded a few 100 Texans reading it. They use these recordings as samples of people's [HESITATES] standard way of speaking as they try to track how speech in Texas varies and changes over time. Would you be willing to read a [HESITATES] brief passage out loud? "

And when I was five, we moved to a farm near White House, which is southeast of Tyler. I liked growin' up in the country. When my chores were done, I'd ride-ride my horse, climb trees, and hike down to the creek to fish or swim. One time we tied a rope to a limb of a cypress tree, and we'd swing out wide over the swimming hole and drop into the water. I'd pretend to be Tarzan swingin' on a vine. In the spring I'd fly kites and on the summer nights we'd catch fireflies, but we called 'em lightnin' bugs. Once in a while we [HESITATES] have fights with corn cobs and pine cones. [SNIFFS] In the winter, we'd build a fire in the fireplace and pop popcorn and roast peanuts and pecans. I guess I was a live wire. When I was 19, I went to work in Dallas at a Firestone Tire store. I didn't like the city life, and for a long time I'd go home every chance I got. Uh, mama would always cook my favorite foods; fried okra, hoppin john, (that's rice and black eyed peas), and a pecan pie. We had a lot of good times, but goin' home, is not the same now. After daddy died, Mama sold the farm [PAUSES] and moved to Tyler. I'd rather be living on the farm right now instead of here in the city, but my wife and kids don't understand me when I gripe about the city life and talk about movin' to the country. My oldest child says \"Daddy, that's crazy. I'd just die if I had to live on a farm.\" I almost cried the first time she said that, and I know ch-Texas is changing. But I tr-try to make sure we don't lose touch with our roots. While we may live in a city, I want my kids to have a good cun-feeling for the land and have a sense of place, uh t-and take pride in being Texas. Uh, if they lose our ties to the land, the price of progress is too high. [SLIDES OVER PAPER] "
