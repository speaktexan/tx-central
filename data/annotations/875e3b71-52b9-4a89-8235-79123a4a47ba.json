And while I was in weather forecasting school, my my home unit where I was supposed to be assigned to online island where I grew up, they shut their weather portion down. So they needed to relocate me. I ended up I was in school with two guys that went to K u. And I decided, I'm going to move to Kansas because they had an opening there. So I relocated from New York to Kansas, met my future business partner in Kansas. And he was already planning on moving to Austin when he graduated. So we connected and this was over no time for social. This is actually for a private weather forecasting company that I started. So at 2425 I picked up. And then, basically, Austin Round Rock. I was in Austin for a little bit, but they had basically been in Round Rock for the last 25, almost 30 years. Gotcha."

I, I it was appealing to me just because it wasn't, I worked in downtown Austin, but wasn't really feeling moving into like the city when I worked down there. So I ended up relocating up here, right after I moved into into Austin and ended up having a business, my business in the Round Rock community. So I think the things that appealed to me was it was a small town when I moved here, so they were probably 30,000 people. And it just seemed like it had everything that I really was looking for as far as like the parks and like I like to fish. So I would come out to Old Settlers Park which by the way, I'm within walking distance now. So I can walk out my front yard and walk across the street and be at the park. So that's always fun. You know, at the time, I wasn't really looking at like school districts and stuff just because I wasn't married, didn't have kids, I was young. But you know, I had a duplex and then I moved into a house over by Stoney Point High School. So it was a it was a brand new community moved in got to know my neighbors and just felt really, really good about being in Round Rock and decided, hey, this is where I'm going to stay. So I think just the appeal of just the small town at the time, obviously now we're growing and growing a lot faster than probably a lot of people want. But I already knew that was coming because I follow the politics a lot. So I already knew Hey, Round Rock is going to be 220,000 people at some point. So but that was the initial probably the initial appeal."

You probably have people from 2530 Different countries like literally all mingling together. Everybody's got you know, their own different things they do. But the diversity I think, to me has been one of the things that I think is a highlight of having different cultures and different people here. So my son plays basketball, for instance, and both of his good buddies and basketball in fact, they just came back a few minutes ago from their camp at Stoney point. Both of his buddies are both from India. So one of the kids is from Northern India the other day Kids from southern India are good friends with both of their dads now."

And I realized that, you know, it takes a lot of planning, and I don't envy, you know, the I know, the Director of Transportation, and so a lot of the, you know, city council members, so I realize they have a big challenge ahead of them. I do feel like some of the pre planning and planning may not be as forward looking as possible. So I'll give you an example. You know, as I mentioned, when I moved here, I would, you know, I attend city council, and I would sort of see some of the things that are going on in the community. And there's always been this push of like, Hey, we're going to build out Round Rock until there's houses and park space and business, right. So you can almost expect all usable land at some point to become used. When you think about that, though, the road planning needs to be done with anticipation of, we may need to widen these roads. So there was a huge project that happened on University Boulevard, right? So they built University Boulevard. And it took him five years to just basically relocate the utilities for a two mile stretch to widen the road. If you already know you're going to be widening a road at some point in time in the future, why not just start the utilities. In the end, I again, I may be completely off here. I don't know anything about utilities, but I know that it took a hell of a long time to relocate those utilities. So I almost feel like it's not done on purpose. But you know, if you don't relocate the utilities at some point, you need to hire somebody which keeps people busy. It's still if you built all the utilities far out, so you could just extend the road later. Nobody would have a job to relocate the utilities. I don't know it's just a weird like, thing that kind of goes through my head as I as I observe things, but"

However, we do work with some nonprofits throughout the area. producing content and also running ads. My typical day is wake up, look at all the alerts for all the various clients we have get into my planning schedule for the day, do I have any sales calls I need to make? Do I have any follow up I need to make, obviously dealing with issues if there's any particular issues with Facebook, or the ads account I need to deal with. We do have a team meeting at 245. Every day, we're mainly remote. So we meet up every day at 245. To go over the day. We use Google meet a lot. So we're constantly Google meet Google Chat, within within the Google platform. But that would be my main day is just focused all on client work and sales calls. And then I've got some administrative stuff I need to do I oversee almost the whole company. So and then we're small, we're just a three person agency. So whether it's processing client payments, dealing with any of that would be my day in and day out. Community wise, I'm on the board of the YMCA. So I actually just had a meeting with them this morning. And I'm also on the board of directors for the ramrod chamber similar to Jessica Jessica is the president of the board. So I've been on the board now for like six years now. And just contribute as much as I can. I'm on the entrepreneurship Committee, which I've been on for a while Jessica has been on that before and has actually headed that up before. So I do a lot of stuff having to do with entrepreneurship, help run 1 Million Cups, which is an event we have, try to attend all the entrepreneurship related events for the chamber and just be as involved as I can."

And it was a shock to a lot of people because I had 1000s of connections in the roofing industry. And when you have that many people that are following you on Facebook, and you know you're managing a page on Facebook running ads just come full on connected. That that turns into something. So what it turned into was a bunch of roofers reaching out to me saying, Hey, Bill, I've got no time for this social media stuff. I didn't even have a company name until I heard that 100 times. Right. So then I named the company no time for social. And all of those connections led me into immediately started my company and beginning to connect with people and say, Okay, you're a roofer, you're an Arkansas, you need help. Here's what we charge, let's go locally here, same type of thing, right. So I've run several campaigns for city council members and for school board members on Facebook for when they're running for office. So obviously, that connection with the various city council members, the mayor, different people I'm connected with lead to Oh, Bill runs a digital marketing agency that runs Facebook, let me put you in touch with him. So my name being out there has certainly helped with I know a person he could help you. I usually I'm very good at speaking with people. And I'm very try to be as helpful as I can. So I just had a chamber member reach out and he needs help with Google ads. So I'm gonna meet with him on Monday in downtown Round Rock, sit down, go through, you know, whatever I can do to help him. A little bit of goodwill goes a long way. So I do sometimes, obviously, I tried to charge for my time when I can, but I usually will speak with anybody and give him an hour of my time just to sort of help out and I feel like that has come full circle so many times. So that's that's basically how my connections in the in the city have worked."

So and that happens not only locally here, but even with our clients throughout the United States. I mentioned roofing, we generate leads for roofers and sometimes hand over fist for like a third of what they would pay on Google. So that that actually is really cool to see where they're getting, you know, a $20,000 roofing job for a $50 lead. So that's, that's really where the most joy comes from."

And the fact that they're unfortunately, their support team does not provide the support needed for the challenges that we face. So if there are any major issues that you're dealing with, and we are dealing with one right now we're up a large bank that we work with their Facebook page was taken down because somebody reported their page as a duplicate page or something. So their AI picked up on it, and just immediately banned the page. We've been working, trying to work with Facebook for one month on like, with like five different tickets open, and there's no way to get them to fix it. And no one really cares. And I think when you don't care, it's a big problem. And, you know, I'm not saying they don't care that the page is down, but there's not enough care to get the resolution come to the table with you know, any sense of urgency. You know, it's a major bank, and their page has been down for a month and the bank is their hands are tied. So if that happens to my company, or any of my other businesses that I'm working with, I don't I my sense of I guess my my feeling is that I will not get the support. So I'm losing a little bit of faith in that. So I it is what it is. I mean, like I said, we've been doing this for 10 years, and I hope I can continue running ads for clients for the next five to six years until I get closer to retirement. But you know, the cards are stacked against us right now, unfortunately. So that's really the biggest challenges in our day, everything else seems to be running smoothly. Obviously getting new clients is always a challenge. And you know, Jessica and I have talked about that over the years. Right? As much as possible. But But yeah, overall, that's the biggest challenge."

I feel like that time period like the late 70s, when a lot of the one hit wonders came out and there was experimentation with and I used to DJ, by the way. So in New York. So I very familiar with tons of different kinds of music, right. And we didn't have any country in New York when I grew up. So I had no idea what country was until I moved to Kansas. But you know, the electronic music like Herbie Hancock and all the hip hop that came out in Long Island, New York and the Bronx, like, I feel like that timeframe, there was so much experimentation to like, go from rock and roll with the 70s and disco into like, all this kind of music. I feel like it just it changed music. I think the 80s did. And then I feel like the 90s was was good. But it's sort of leveled out a little bit. And there was maybe level less one hit wonders going on, and have these like one off songs that were really exciting. And so that's my opinion on music."

But read this passage just so we could have your voice on recording. We could look into kind of the linguistic aspects of how your I guess voice in comparison to others in Texas? Oh, maybe not. Because I'm on let me send in the chat. So perhaps not because it's a bit too long. So we might have a pass on that. But nonetheless, I really appreciate you for taking time to see me today.
