And I told Courtney, I said, I don't feel so great. I think I'm gonna slip out a little early this afternoon. She said, sure, go ahead. I said, I just really think I'm gonna throw up and I don't wanna throw up in front of these, this group of ninth graders. So I left and I came home. And before I got home, I had to stop my car twice because I was sick at my stomach. So, long story short, I had to have an emergency appendectomy. So for the, the next three weeks or so, every time I checked the mailbox, I had another bill from a doctor, but I didn't even see.  "

I like growing up in the country. When my chores were done, I'd ride my horse climb trees or hike down to the creek to fish or swim. One time we tied a rope to a limb of a cypress tree and we'd swing out wide over the swimming hole and drop into the water. I'd pretend to be tarn swinging on a vine. In the spring, I'd fly cos and on summer nights we'd catch fireflies, but we call them lightning bugs. Once in a while we'd have fights with corn cobs or pine cones. In the winter, we'd build a fire in the fireplace and pop popcorn and roast peanuts and pecans. I guess I was a alive wire when I was 19.  "

Fried okra, hop and John, that's rice and black-eyed peas and pecan pie. We had lots of good times, but going home is not the same. Now. After daddy died, mama sold the farm and moved to Tyler. I'd rather be living on a farm right now instead of here in the city. But my wife and kids don't understand me. When I gripe about city life and talk about moving to the country, my oldest child says, daddy, that's crazy. I just die. I had to live on a farm. I almost cried the first time. She said that. I know Texas is changing, but I try to make sure we don't lose touch with our roots. While we may live in a city. I want my kids to have a good feeling for land, have a sense of place, and take pride in being Texans. If they lose, if they lose, if they lose our ties to the land, the price of progress is too high.  "
