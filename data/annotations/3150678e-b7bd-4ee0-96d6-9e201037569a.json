And so\nwe used to have at that time uh it was the rotary Special Olympics. And so it was at [COMMUNITY\nHIGH SCHOOL], and just started volunteering there. And did that for as long as we have that almost 15\nyears. And so it changed a little bit on that side. And Special Olympics changed how we did it for\nqualifying meets and so we don't have it anymore. And I really use it because it was a great community\nthat- but that's where it started was just volunteering a couple hours there. And then it grew into people\nstarted asking myself and others, I want to make sure that this is more about an entire peer group and it\nis myself and just started seeing those out and hey, you got some time, can you come help me with\nthis?

As part of this project, a linguistic researcher is asking that interview\nparticipants read a brief passage, which should only take a couple of minutes. It's a short made up\nstory about a life in Texas that was created in the 1980s and since then, linguistic researchers have\nrecorded a few 100 Texans reading it. They now use these recordings as samples of people standard\nway of speaking as they try to track how speech in Texas varies and changes over time. Would you be\nwilling to read this brief passage out loud?"

I like growing up in the country. When my chores were done, I'd ride my horse contries or hike down to the creek to fish or swim. One time we try we tied a rope to a limb on a cypress tree, and we'd swing out wide over the swing bowl and drop into the water. I'd pretend to be Tarzan swinging on the vine. In the springtime, I'd like to fly kites and on summer nights we'd catch fireflies, but we call them lightning bugs. Once in a while. We'd have fights with corn cobs or pine cones. In the winter, we build a fire in the fireplace and pop popcorn and roast peanuts and pecans. I guess I was a live wire. When I was 19 I went to work in Dallas at a Firestone Tire store. I didn't like city life and for a long time I'd go home every chance I got. Mama would always cook my favorite foods: fried okra, Uppin John, that's rice with black eyed peas, and pecan pie. We had lots of good times, but going home is not the same now. After daddy died and Mama sold the farm and moved to Tyler. I'd rather be living on a farm right now instead of in the city. But my wife and kids don't understand when I gripe about the city life talk about moving to the country. My oldest child says Daddy, that's crazy, I just die if I had to live on a farm. I almost cried the first time she said that. I know Texas is changing but I'm trying to make sure we don't lose touch with our roots. While we may live in a city I want my kids to have a good- good feeling for the land, have a sense of place, and take pride in being Texan. If they- if we lose our ties to the land, the price of progress is too high"
