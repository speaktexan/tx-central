As part of this project, a linguistic researcher is asking that interview participants read a brief passage, which should only take a couple of minutes. It's a short made up story about life in Texas that was created in the 1980s and since then, linguistic researchers have recorded a few 100 Texans reading it. They use these recordings as samples of people's standard way of speaking as they try to track how speech in Texas varies and changes over time. Would you be willing to read a brief passage out loud?  "

And when I was five, we moved to a farm near White House and with a south east of Tyler. like growing up in the county. When my chores were done, I ride my horse climb trees or hike down to the creek to fish or swim one time we try to walk to a limb on the cypress tree and we swing out wide over the swimming hole and drop into the water. I pretended to be a Tarzan swinging on the vine. In the spring I like I fly kites and on summer nights we catch fireflies but we call them lightning bugs. Once in a while we had fights with corn cobs or pine cones in the winter we build a fire in the fireplace and pop popcorn and roasted peanuts and pecans. I guess I was live wire when I was 19 I went to work in Dallas as a Firestone Tire and I didn't like city life and for a long time I go home chan- every chance I got. Mama would always cook my favorite foods. Fried okra, hoppin John, that's rice and black eyed peas and pecan pie. We had lots of good times but going on to is not the same now. After daddy died, Mama sold the farm and moved to Taylor. I rather be living on a farm right now instead of here in the city. But my wife and kids don't understand me when I whi- gripe about my gripe about city life and talk about moving to the country. My oldest child says Daddy, that's crazy. I'll just die if I had to live in a form. I almost cried the first time she said that. I know Texas is changing but I tried to make sure we don't lose touch with our roots. While we have live in the city. I want my kids to have a good feeling For the land, have a sense of place and make pride in being Texans. If they lose or if we lose our ties to the land. The price of progress is too high. "
