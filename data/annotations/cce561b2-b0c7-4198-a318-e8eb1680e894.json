And when I\nwas five we moved to a farm near White House, which is south east of Ty- Tyler, sorry. I like growing\nup in the country. When my chores were done, I'd ride my horse, climb trees or hike down uh, the creek\nto fish or swim. One time we tied a rope to a limb of the cypress tree we - and we would swing out wide,\nover the swimming hole and drop into the water. I pretend to be Tarzan swinging on the vine. In the\nspring, I fly kites and on summer nights we'd catch fireflies. We would call them lightning bugs. Once in\na while, we would have fights in the corncob or pine cones. In-in-in-in the winter, we'd build to fire in the\nfireplace and pop popcorn and roast peanuts and pecans. I guess I was a live wire. When I was 19, I\nwent to work in Dallas at the- at a Firestone Tire store. I didn't like city life. For a long time, I would go\nhome every chance I got. Mama would always cook my favorite foods, fried okra, hoppin john, that rice\nand the black eyed peas and pecan pie. We had a lot of good times, but going home was not the same\nnow after daddy died. Okay, but going home, it's not the same. Now. After daddy died, Mama sold the\nfarm and moved to Tyler. I rather be living on a farm right now instead of here in the city, but my wife\nand kids don't understand when I gripe about the city life and talk about moving to the country. Uh-uh-\num my oldest child said, \"Daddy, that's crazy. I'd just die if I had to live on a farm.\" I almost cried for the\nfirst time when she said that. I know Texas is changing. But I try to make sure we don't lose in touch\nwith our roots. While we may live in the city, I want my kids to have the good feeling for the land, have a\nsense of place and take pride in being Texans. If we lose our ties to the land, the price of progress is\ntoo high. [PAUSE] Is that exactly my story that I was talking about-"
