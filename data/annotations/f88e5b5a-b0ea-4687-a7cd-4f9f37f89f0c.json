You know, because kids will be kids. And, it's just\nthe all the hoops you have to jump through. Um. For instance, you know, I worked with violent kids\nmost of the time. Well, not most of the time, but at the end of my career, because I'm very even-\ntempered. And we had to do this thing called CPI training, which is um, Crisis Prevention Intervention.\nAnd so they were safe holds to hold a kid that's in crisis, so that you wouldn't get hurt, and you wouldn't\nhurt, hurt the kid. Um, and in that training, they say, \"Never go anywhere by yourself with a child.\" Well,\nif you have a violent child, and you have to go across campus, the district is not going to pay to have\ntwo employees to go anywhere, much less stay in a room. You know, it's just not financially feasible to do that. So you couldn't do anything that they told you in training. And then when something did happen, and you did get hurt... Um, like one of the kids threw a chair at the principal, and she had to go to the emergency room. Um. And then it's like, \"Well, why didn't you follow the CPI procedures?\" And,\nand, you know, it sounds bad, but it's like a woman that, that gets raped. You know, like, \"Well, why did\nyou do that? What that caused you to...\" You know, you're doing your job, and you're doing everything\nyou can to be safe, and you get hurt. And then it's your fault. And so, you know, the policies and\nprocedures and their ideas were just ridiculous. But the kids were just amazing. Even if they were\nhurting you in the moment, that wasn't their intent. So you couldn't really get mad at the kid. So. Oh,\nand then coworkers. There's some such bad teachers. It's ridiculous. They hate kids. And they're yelling\nconstantly at the kids. And they're keeping their jobs somehow. I- I don't know. And they're dumb.\nSome teachers are just dumb. And shouldn't be teaching."

It's still not the case, I think still\nwomen are funneled into teaching. And some people that don't know what they're going to do they just\nbecome a teacher, because that's what women do. And that's, a lot of the problem is that they think,\n\"Oh, well, you know, I want to be a mother someday, I like kids, I'll be a teacher.\" And, it's not, you\nknow... And then, the, it's male dominated at the top. And they don't know how to deal with these, the\nwomen issues. So I think, I mean, that sounds horrible and sexist.

I liked growing up in the country.\nWhen my chores were done, I'd ride my horse, climb trees or hike down the creek to fish or swim. One\ntime we tied a rope to a limb of a cypress tree and we'd swing out wide over the swimming hole and\ndrop into the water. I pretend to be Tarzan swinging on a vine.\" [LAUGHING] I would do this as a kid. Um. \"In the spring, I'd fly kites and on summer nights we'd catch fireflies, but we called them lightning bugs. Once in a while we'd have fights with corncob or pine cones. In the winter we build a fire in a fireplace and pop popcorn and roast peanuts and pecans. I guess I was a Livewire. When I was 19 I\nwent to work in Dallas at a Firestone Tire store. I didn't like city life. And for a long time I'd go home\nevery chance I got. Mama would always cook my favorite foods fried okra. hoppin john, that's rice and\nblack eyed peas, and pecan pie. We had lots of good times, but going home is not the same now. After\ndaddy died, Mama sold the farm and moved to Tyler. I'd rather be living on a farm right now instead of\nhere in the city. But my wife and kids don't understand me when I gripe about city life and talk about\nmoving to the country. My oldest child says, \"Daddy, that's crazy. I'd just die if I had to live on a farm.\" I\nalmost cried the first time she said that. I know Texas is changing, but I try to make sure we don't lose\ntouch with our roots. While we may live in this, in a city, I want my kids to have a good feeling for the\nland. Have a sense of place and take pride in being Texans. If they lose our ties to the land the price of\nprogress is too high."

Well, not most of the time, but at the end of my career, because I'm very even-\ntempered. And we had to do this thing called CPI training, which is um, Crisis Prevention Intervention.\nAnd so they were safe holds to hold a kid that's in crisis, so that you wouldn't get hurt, and you wouldn't\nhurt, hurt the kid. Um, and in that training, they say, \"Never go anywhere by yourself with a child.\" Well,\nif you have a violent child, and you have to go across campus, the district is not going to pay to have\ntwo employees to go anywhere, much less stay in a room. You know, it's just not financially feasible to do that. So you couldn't do anything that they told you in training. And then when something did happen, and you did get hurt... Um, like one of the kids threw a chair at the principal, and she had to go to the emergency room. Um. And then it's like, \"Well, why didn't you follow the CPI procedures?\" And,\nand, you know, it sounds bad, but it's like a woman that, that gets raped. You know, like, \"Well, why did\nyou do that? What that caused you to...\" You know, you're doing your job, and you're doing everything\nyou can to be safe, and you get hurt. And then it's your fault. And so, you know, the policies and\nprocedures and their ideas were just ridiculous. But the kids were just amazing. Even if they were\nhurting you in the moment, that wasn't their intent. So you couldn't really get mad at the kid. So. Oh,\nand then coworkers. There's some such bad teachers. It's ridiculous. They hate kids. And they're yelling\nconstantly at the kids. And they're keeping their jobs somehow. I- I don't know. And they're dumb.\nSome teachers are just dumb. And shouldn't be teaching."

And you have teachers that get\ntheir curriculum off Pinterest and decide this is a good thing to do when you're given the day to day. So,\nincompetent. There's just incompetence too. Okay. There was a lot I didn't like obviously, [LAUGHING]\nat the end."

And I don't know if it's because it's a female dominated profession. And, you know, we're,\nyou would think we're really into it, where women can do anything. Um. It's still not the case, I think still\nwomen are funneled into teaching. And some people that don't know what they're going to do they just\nbecome a teacher, because that's what women do. And that's, a lot of the problem is that they think,\n\"Oh, well, you know, I want to be a mother someday, I like kids, I'll be a teacher.\" And, it's not, you\nknow... And then, the, it's male dominated at the top. And they don't know how to deal with these, the\nwomen issues. So I think, I mean, that sounds horrible and sexist. But I think if it was um, if teachers\nwere trained more like a business, rather than a teacher is, then I think we'd be better off and they\nwould get- and paid better also- because, a lot of men don't become teachers because the pay is bad.\nAnd if they just raised the pay, and ran it as a business, be way better.

But his high school music was foul mouth, rap music, that all the kids at\nhis high school... I don't know if your brother did, but were listening to this foul mouthed, high school\nmusic, like this rap music. And when my son went to the college, he worked at the Harvard radio\nstation, and he was a DJ at two or three in the morning, for an hour, he an hour segment. So of course,\nI'd set my alarm. And I would listen to him and record him on the radio. And the biggest joke would be\nto write down the titles and then when we're having Thanksgiving with his grandmother... Play some of\nhis selections! And they were the foulest, raunchiest, rap music known to the planet. [DOG WALKING\nACROSS FLOOR] So it's very funny. [LAUGHS]"

I liked growing up in the country.\nWhen my chores were done, I'd ride my horse, climb trees or hike down the creek to fish or swim. One\ntime we tied a rope to a limb of a cypress tree and we'd swing out wide over the swimming hole and\ndrop into the water. I pretend to be Tarzan swinging on a vine.\" [LAUGHING] I would do this as a kid. Um. \"In the spring, I'd fly kites and on summer nights we'd catch fireflies, but we called them lightning bugs. Once in a while we'd have fights with corncob or pine cones. In the winter we build a fire in a fireplace and pop popcorn and roast peanuts and pecans. I guess I was a Livewire. When I was 19 I\nwent to work in Dallas at a Firestone Tire store. I didn't like city life. And for a long time I'd go home\nevery chance I got. Mama would always cook my favorite foods fried okra. hoppin john, that's rice and\nblack eyed peas, and pecan pie. We had lots of good times, but going home is not the same now. After\ndaddy died, Mama sold the farm and moved to Tyler. I'd rather be living on a farm right now instead of\nhere in the city. But my wife and kids don't understand me when I gripe about city life and talk about\nmoving to the country. My oldest child says, \"Daddy, that's crazy. I'd just die if I had to live on a farm.\" I\nalmost cried the first time she said that. I know Texas is changing, but I try to make sure we don't lose\ntouch with our roots. While we may live in this, in a city, I want my kids to have a good feeling for the\nland. Have a sense of place and take pride in being Texans. If they lose our ties to the land the price of\nprogress is too high."
