And while I was in weather forecasting school, my my home unit where I was\nsupposed to be assigned to online island where I grew up, they shut their weather portion down. So\nthey needed to relocate me. I ended up I was in school with two guys that went to K u. And I decided,\nI'm going to move to Kansas because they had an opening there. So I relocated from New York to\nKansas, met my future business partner in Kansas. And he was already planning on moving to Austin\nwhen he graduated. So we connected and this was over no time for social. This is actually for a private\nweather forecasting company that I started. So at 2425 I picked up. And then, basically, Austin Round\nRock. I was in Austin for a little bit, but they had basically been in Round Rock for the last 25, almost 30\nyears. Gotcha."

I, I it was\nappealing to me just because it wasn't, I worked in downtown Austin, but wasn't really feeling moving\ninto like the city when I worked down there. So I ended up relocating up here, right after I moved into\ninto Austin and ended up having a business, my business in the Round Rock community. So I think the\nthings that appealed to me was it was a small town when I moved here, so they were probably 30,000\npeople. And it just seemed like it had everything that I really was looking for as far as like the parks and\nlike I like to fish. So I would come out to Old Settlers Park which by the way, I'm within walking distance\nnow. So I can walk out my front yard and walk across the street and be at the park. So that's always\nfun. You know, at the time, I wasn't really looking at like school districts and stuff just because I wasn't\nmarried, didn't have kids, I was young. But you know, I had a duplex and then I moved into a house\nover by Stoney Point High School. So it was a it was a brand new community moved in got to know my\nneighbors and just felt really, really good about being in Round Rock and decided, hey, this is where\nI'm going to stay. So I think just the appeal of just the small town at the time, obviously now we're\ngrowing and growing a lot faster than probably a lot of people want. But I already knew that was coming\nbecause I follow the politics a lot. So I already knew Hey, Round Rock is going to be 220,000 people at\nsome point. So but that was the initial probably the initial appeal."

You know, you go out to Old Settlers park on a nice fall day\nor a nice spring day where you know, you're gonna have a lot of people out there. You probably have\npeople from 2530 Different countries like literally all mingling together. Everybody's got you know, their\nown different things they do. But the diversity I think, to me has been one of the things that I think is a\nhighlight of having different cultures and different people here. So my son plays basketball, for instance,\nand both of his good buddies and basketball in fact, they just came back a few minutes ago from their\ncamp at Stoney point. Both of his buddies are both from India. So one of the kids is from Northern India\nthe other day Kids from southern India are good friends with both of their dads now."

And I realized that, you know, it takes a lot of planning, and I don't envy, you know, the I\nknow, the Director of Transportation, and so a lot of the, you know, city council members, so I realize they have a big challenge ahead of them. I do feel like some of the pre planning and planning may not be as forward looking as possible. So I'll give you an example. You know, as I mentioned, when I moved here, I would, you know, I attend city council, and I would sort of see some of the things that are\ngoing on in the community. And there's always been this push of like, Hey, we're going to build out Round Rock until there's houses and park space and business, right. So you can almost expect all usable land at some point to become used. When you think about that, though, the road planning needs to be done with anticipation of, we may need to widen these roads. So there was a huge project\nthat happened on University Boulevard, right? So they built University Boulevard. And it took him five years to just basically relocate the utilities for a two mile stretch to widen the road. If you already know you're going to be widening a road at some point in time in the future, why not just start the utilities. In the end, I again, I may be completely off here. I don't know anything about utilities, but I know that it\ntook a hell of a long time to relocate those utilities. So I almost feel like it's not done on purpose. But you know, if you don't relocate the utilities at some point, you need to hire somebody which keeps people busy. It's still if you built all the utilities far out, so you could just extend the road later. Nobody would have a job to relocate the utilities. I don't know it's just a weird like, thing that kind of goes through my head as I as I observe things, but"
