Um being in the [COMMUNITY PROGRAM NAME], that was one of the questions that was asked on the application actually, and that was also my response there was infrastructure. Other weaknesses I think are probably just would in a more personal way would be activities here. It is a college town so most everything that people try to open up and do gets taken over by the college kids so there's not like an adult type of activity or things to do here much. Um. Usually if I'm going to do anything, I'd go South because that gives me more options. Um. And that's just kind of a personal thing.

It's great to have these community connections, you definitely need them as a leader. But I do think that learning how to deal with management and teams of people and different personalities, and then applying your own skill set to be able to manage those people is super, super important.

And um you got a lot of community involvement there, in trying to get community support, community guidance. Trying to build up and provide a service to the veteran students that were on campus. Um. We were one of the first universities to get a VA counselor on site and she's still there today. And that was, that was really special to us, because she could serve our students, but she could also serve the community if someone wanted to visit with her about things. And she did something completely different from school, you know, she was helping them with hospitals and medical visit, counseling services and trying to to guide them through that. Um. When we started that we were in the era of combat veterans coming in. And so transitioning them to uh civilian life and to to higher ED and, and trying to make them feel included, not different, was a little bit of a challenge. And I don't know that I would say we ever perfected it, because I think people come back with experiences that you can't even imagine when they're in combat. So I hope that we helped it some, I wouldn't say that we fixed anything necessarily. We just gave them a little place to fall if they needed to fall. Um. So I had a lot of community involvement there with veteran members of the community. Um. In my role as an Associate Vice President, um it was a little bit more limited. Um. You know, the higher up you go, it seems like the less you really have a lot of people contact, but um the departments underneath me still relied on community for support. I mean, the financial aid department goes out to the high school every day. So we have a connection there with the superintendent and the counselors at the high school on every day they go and do the FAFSA out there. And that was the department that reported to me. Um. Other than that, I can't really think of any tie community ties, um registrar's office was another office that reported to me, which not a lot of community effort there, there wasn't I mean, we're registering students, and we dealt with their parents, but that, they could be in the community, they could be out of the community. Um. And we didn't do any type of fundraising or anything like that. With the chamber, I've had a lot more of that and that's been one of my most favorite things about being here is being immersed into the community, because didn't really get that too much at [TEXAS UNIVERSITY NAME]. You know, and now I've got connections with presidents of banks and companies, large companies, small business owners, just there's so many connections that I've made here. And that's been the most fun part of this job. "

Or maybe they need something notarized and we handle those kinds of things in here as well. Um. But mostly, it's a greater.

But it just wasn't something that made my parents want to have me right here and not be able to go and and do things. Um. And part of that. A large part of that is because it was such a rural-rural area to live in. Um. You know we're, before we moved, we were in [DIFFERENT UPPER GOLF COAST REGION COMMUNITY NAME], and it was it was a scary thing for my parents to have to worry about me going to the skating rink or anything that they weren't actually physically there. And so there was a lot of freedom that came with moving up here. And not not bad freedom, good freedom. You know the freedom to walk down half mile to your friend's house and not have to worry about much. You know um so I don't know. I think freedom would be the thing in my mind when I think back to being a child and how it was when we lived in [DIFFERENT UPPER GOLF COAST REGION COMMUNITY NAME] and so contained and so you know you can't go here, you can't go there.

And it's, I don't know, to me so much of it is just screaming at the top of your lungs where it's not a nice country song any more you know. So that's changed a lot for me too.

Some of the older people I loved Conway Twitty. Thought he was pretty awesome. Um. Yeah so. "

I mean, I was playing baseball in the front yard with the boys and riding skateboards and building ramps for bicycles and jumping, you know, and tire swings, and she was more baby dolls and imaginary friends and hanging out in her bedroom. I spent the night every every chance I got to go somewhere else. I was doing it. And she hardly ever spent the night anywhere. She was always at home. Um. So it wasn't like I had a best friend in her necessarily. Um. She was also really, really tiny. And so I always felt a need to to take up for her. So if we got in trouble. I usually tried to take the brunt of the trouble that we got into. Um. I was very protective of her, even though there wasn't like a really strong strong bond between us and maybe that's just something siblings do. I don't know. But um it was nice to have her. I wouldn't say that, you know, she was my best friend or anything just because we were just so different. And like I said we still are today she's, I don't know I always tell her mother I don't know what's wrong with her. [LAUGHS] "

I liked growing up in the country. When my chores were done, I'd ride my horse, climb trees, or hike down to the creek to fish or swim. One time we tied a rope to a limb of a cypress tree, and we'd swing out wide over the swimming hole and drop into the water. I'd pretend to be Tarzan swinging on the vine. In the spring, I'd fly kites and on summer nights we catch fireflies, but we'd called them lightning bugs. Once in a while we'd have fights with the corn cobs or pine cones. In the winter, we'd build a fire in the fireplace and pop popcorn and roast peanuts and pecans. I guess I was a Livewire. When I was 19, I went to work in Dallas at a Firestone Firestone Tire store. I didn't like city life and for a long time I'd go home every chance I got. Mama would always cook my favorite foods, fried okra, hopping John, that's rice and black eyed peas and pecan pie. We had lots of good times, but going home is not the same now. After daddy died, Mama sold the farm and moved to Tyler. I'd rather be living on a farm right now instead of here in the city. But my wife and kids don't understand, understand me when I gripe about city live and talk about moving to the country. My oldest child says daddy that's crazy. I'd just die if I had to live on a farm. I almost cried the first time she said that. I know Texas is changing, but I try to make sure we don't lose touch with our roots. While we may live in a city, I want my kids to have a good feeling for the land have a sense of place and take pride in being Texans. If they lose our ties to the land, the price of progress is too high.  "
