And\num that wasn't something that I at the time was interested in, and at least in that, and so he was like,\nWell, what are you going to do with the history degree? Why don't you get your teaching certificate as\nwell. So I did that. And um in, I ended up, it surprised me, like I ended up doing teaching right away, I\nwas supposed to get my master's, I had already signed up at [LOCAL UNIVERSITY] to do their\ncounseling degree. And I had um stomach problems. And to the point where the doctor said, you don't\nneed to work. You don't need to go to school. So I didn't go to school. But then I was like, I can't just sit\nhere.

And um, you know, back when I was teaching, I would say it was um\ndepending on which school there were different problems, like the school I taught at, over here off of\n[LOCAL STREET] um [ELEMENTARY SCHOOL NAME] was um had some real issues with\nsurprisingly um, some of the kids that went there, their parents were in the Mexican Mafia, and they\nwere in counseling. Um, Because there would be like drive by shootings and things like that. So they\nlike you were kind of up against sort of some really hard life things um that these kids were going\nthrough, but also trying to teach them something, which was kind of my first sort of understanding of, I\nmean, honestly, that's a huge counseling uh, right there a huge um counseling lesson. Right, I didn't I\nmean, that school in, not just in theory in the books, it's like in reality, right having to work with the\nstudent that um and they ended up having to tell me. Normally a teacher may not know the information,\nbut they ended up having to tell me about one particular girl. Um, but they let me know that there were\nseveral in my class that have this issue, right. But this one particular girl would I showed up one day at\n6:30. And she was already there. And she was crying in the classroom and shaking. And so I needed-\nthey needed to inform me. So that year that was really challenging, um that I had a great class, but it\nwas they definitely dealt with some different things. And then I moved from there to private school the\nnext time I actually moved to [CENTRAL TEXAS CITY], and then back to [COMMUNITY NAME]. And\num, and when I moved back, I mean, we were only in [CENTRAL TEXAS CITY] for like, a year. And\nthen I moved back. And I did private school after that. And that was, those were different set of\nproblems, you know, just depending on, but yeah, the day you asked me what the day looked like it.\nUm, in elementary school, you kind of teach everything, except for like I had, we had um things that we\ntaught every day. And then we did divide some of the subjects. So I did teach other classes, too. That\nmakes sense?"

And so in order to make that um, like, actually look like an\nlegitimate thing where they're not kind of questioning why is she calling and saying this cheesy thing. I\nwould just sort of watch the classroom. And then I would pick a kid out of that, like, if a something good\nhappened that day, I would pick that kid. But I just kept it a little checkmark in my gradebook so that I\nknew I had called them already and kind of shared something positive. And that was the hugest thing,\nbecause if I ever had any negatives with the kids, the parents all listened to me. And so really I-I loved\nlike, I love sort of, I know it sounds crazy, but I loved like actually finding positives in my day. And it\nhelped me to be more thankful about my day just because you can sometimes there's days where\nyou're just like, the class was awful and this and you can get negative, you know, but when I was\nalways looking for something someone was doing that-that showed some growth, it helped me to, to\nfeel like-so honestly, that's what I loved about teaching was just kind of finding that."

I think our prices are rising as well, grocery, we just even talking today to the um\ngirl that was doing my nails. And she's so cute, but she's from um Vietnam. And um she was she's\nprobably, I don't know, 28, I would guess. And I like to ask her a lot of questions about how it feels to\nlive here, you know, and she loves Texas, and she loves being here. And um she was even talking\nabout politics and stuff. But one of the things I think she noticed is like there was sort of this change,\nespecially after COVID. And it's hard when you're in a community and you're in a situation to say, Oh,\nthis is happening everywhere, or it's not happening everywhere. You-It's really difficult to see. Even if\nyou're doing research like this all across, you're getting only just a handful of answers, right? It's hard to\nsee everyone's perspective, but it does feel like there's that it's changed a little bit. Just how\n[COMMUNITY NAME] is."

So y'all want to come help me. And they did. And so my mom was like, laughing because\nshe looks out the window. And I'm like, getting people to do my chores.

I liked growing up in the country and when my\nchores were done I'd ride my horse, climb trees or hike down to the creek to fish or swim. One time we\ntied a rope to a limb of a cypress tree, and we'd swing out wide over the swimming hole and drop into\nthe water. I'd pretend to be Tarzan swinging on a vine. In the spring I'd fly kites, and on summer nights\nwe'd catch fireflies, but we called them lightning bugs. Once in a while we'd have bites with corn cobs\nor pine cones. And in the winter, we build a fire in the fireplace and pop popcorn and roast peanuts and\npecans. I guess I was a Livewire. When I was 19 I went to work in Dallas at a Firestone Tire store. I\ndidn't like city life, and for a long time I'd go home every chance I got. Mama would always cook my\nfavorite foods fried okra, hoppin john, that's-that's rice and black-black eyed peas and pecan pie. We\nhad lots of good times, but going home is not the same now. After daddy died, mama tol-sold the farm\nand moved to Tyler. I'd rather be living on a farm right now instead of here in the city. My wife and my\nkids don't understand me when I gripe about city life and talk about moving to a country. I'm sorry to the\ncountry. My oldest child says \"Daddy, that's crazy. I'd just die if I had to live on a farm.\" I almost cried\nthe first time she said that. I know Texas is changing, but I try to make sure we don't lose touch with our\nroots. While we may live in a city, I want my kids to have a good feeling for the land. Have a sense of\nplace and take pride in being Texans. If they lose our-if they lose our ties to the land, the price of\nprogress is too high."
