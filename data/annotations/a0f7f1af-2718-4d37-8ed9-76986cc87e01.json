I was born in Titus\nCounty, and when I was five, we moved to a farm near Whitehouse, which is South East of Tyler. I liked\ngrowing up the country. When my chores were done, I'd ride my horse, climb trees or hike down to the\ncreek, quick, to fish or swim. One time we tied a rope to the limb of a cypress tree, and we'd swing out\nwide over the swimming hole and drop into the water. I'd pretend to be Tarzan swinging on the vine. In\nthe Spring, I'd fly kites and on Summer nights we'd catch fireflies, which we called them lightning bugs.\nOnce in a while, we had fights with corn cobs or pine cones. In the Winter we build a fire in the fireplace\nand pop popcorn and roast peanuts and pecans. I guess I was live wire"

I didn't like city life and for a long time I'd go home every chance I got.\nMy mom would always cook my favorite foods fried okra, hoppin john, that rice and black eyed peas,\nand pecan pie. We had lots of good times, but going home is not the same now, After Daddy died, mom\nsold the farm and moved to Tyler. I'd rather be living on a farm right now instead of here in the city, but\nmy wife and kids don't understand me when I gripe about city life and talk about moving to the country.\nMy oldest child says, \"Daddy, that's crazy! I'd just die if I had to live on a farm!\" I almost cried the first\ntime she said that. I know Texas is changing, but I tried to make sure they, excuse me, I have tried to\nmake sure we don't lose touch with our roots. While we may live in a city, I want my kids to have a good\nfeeling for the land, have a sense of place, and take pride in being Texans. If they lose our ties to the\nland, the price of progress is too high."
