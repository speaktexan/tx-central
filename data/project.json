And um, you know, back when I was teaching, I would say it was um\ndepending on which school there were different problems, like the school I taught at, over here off of\n[LOCAL STREET] um [ELEMENTARY SCHOOL NAME] was um had some real issues with\nsurprisingly um, some of the kids that went there, their parents were in the Mexican Mafia, and they\nwere in counseling. Um, Because there would be like drive by shootings and things like that. So they\nlike you were kind of up against sort of some really hard life things um that these kids were going\nthrough, but also trying to teach them something, which was kind of my first sort of understanding of, I\nmean, honestly, that's a huge counseling uh, right there a huge um counseling lesson. Right, I didn't I\nmean, that school in, not just in theory in the books, it's like in reality, right having to work with the\nstudent that um and they ended up having to tell me. Normally a teacher may not know the information,\nbut they ended up having to tell me about one particular girl. Um, but they let me know that there were\nseveral in my class that have this issue, right. But this one particular girl would I showed up one day at\n6:30. And she was already there. And she was crying in the classroom and shaking. And so I needed-\nthey needed to inform me. So that year that was really challenging, um that I had a great class, but it\nwas they definitely dealt with some different things. And then I moved from there to private school the\nnext time I actually moved to [CENTRAL TEXAS CITY], and then back to [COMMUNITY NAME]. And\num, and when I moved back, I mean, we were only in [CENTRAL TEXAS CITY] for like, a year. And\nthen I moved back. And I did private school after that. And that was, those were different set of\nproblems, you know, just depending on, but yeah, the day you asked me what the day looked like it.\nUm, in elementary school, you kind of teach everything, except for like I had, we had um things that we\ntaught every day. And then we did divide some of the subjects. So I did teach other classes, too. That\nmakes sense?"

So she taught me how to encourage.\nAnd like um I would call parents. So I make calls every single day. And I chose three parents to call.\nAnd I would tell them something good. And so in order to make that um, like, actually look like an\nlegitimate thing where they're not kind of questioning why is she calling and saying this cheesy thing. I\nwould just sort of watch the classroom. And then I would pick a kid out of that, like, if a something good\nhappened that day, I would pick that kid. But I just kept it a little checkmark in my gradebook so that I\nknew I had called them already and kind of shared something positive. And that was the hugest thing,\nbecause if I ever had any negatives with the kids, the parents all listened to me. And so really I-I loved\nlike, I love sort of, I know it sounds crazy, but I loved like actually finding positives in my day. And it\nhelped me to be more thankful about my day just because you can sometimes there's days where\nyou're just like, the class was awful and this and you can get negative, you know, but when I was\nalways looking for something someone was doing that-that showed some growth, it helped me to, to\nfeel like-so honestly, that's what I loved about teaching was just kind of finding that."

I liked growing up in the country and when my\nchores were done I'd ride my horse, climb trees or hike down to the creek to fish or swim. One time we\ntied a rope to a limb of a cypress tree, and we'd swing out wide over the swimming hole and drop into\nthe water. I'd pretend to be Tarzan swinging on a vine. In the spring I'd fly kites, and on summer nights\nwe'd catch fireflies, but we called them lightning bugs. Once in a while we'd have bites with corn cobs\nor pine cones. And in the winter, we build a fire in the fireplace and pop popcorn and roast peanuts and\npecans. I guess I was a Livewire. When I was 19 I went to work in Dallas at a Firestone Tire store. I\ndidn't like city life, and for a long time I'd go home every chance I got. Mama would always cook my\nfavorite foods fried okra, hoppin john, that's-that's rice and black-black eyed peas and pecan pie. We\nhad lots of good times, but going home is not the same now. After daddy died, mama tol-sold the farm\nand moved to Tyler. I'd rather be living on a farm right now instead of here in the city. My wife and my\nkids don't understand me when I gripe about city life and talk about moving to a country. I'm sorry to the\ncountry. My oldest child says \"Daddy, that's crazy. I'd just die if I had to live on a farm.\" I almost cried\nthe first time she said that. I know Texas is changing, but I try to make sure we don't lose touch with our\nroots. While we may live in a city, I want my kids to have a good feeling for the land. Have a sense of\nplace and take pride in being Texans. If they lose our-if they lose our ties to the land, the price of\nprogress is too high."

I liked growing up in the country. When my choices were\ndone. I mean, when my chores were done, I'd ride my horse, climb trees, or hike down the creek to fish\nand swim. One time we tried to rope, um, to a limb of a cypress tree, and we'd swing out over the\nswimming hole and drop into the water. I'd pretend to be Tarzan swinging on the vine. In the spring, I'd\nfly kites and on summer nights, we'd watch fireflies, but we call them lightning bugs. While, uh, once in\na while. [TONGUE SMACKS] We'd have fights with corn cobs and pine cones. In the winter we'd build\na fire in the fireplace and pop popcorn and roast peanuts and pecans. I guess I was a live wire. When I\nwas 19 I went to work in Dallas at Firestone Tire store. I didn't like li- uh, city life and for a long time I'd\ngo home every chance I got. [LAUGHS] Mama would always cook my favorite foods. Fried okra, hoppin\njohn, that's the rice and black eyed peas, and pecan pie. We had lots of good times, but going home is\nnot the same now. After daddy died, Mama sold the farm and moved to Tyler. I'd rather be living on the\nfarm right now instead of here in the city, but my wife and kids don't understand me when I gripe about\ncity life [LAUGHS] and talk about moving to the country. My oldest child says \"Daddy, you're crazy,\" or\n\"that's crazy. I just die if I had to live on a farm.\" [CLEARS THROAT] I almost cried the first time she\nsaid that. I know Texas is changing, but I try to make sure it doesn't lose touch with its roots or with our\nroots. While we may live in the city, I want my kids to have a good feeling for the land, [SNIFFLES]\nmmm, have a sense of place and take pride of being Texans. If they lose their ties to the land, the price\nof progress is too high."

And uh shop down there with my mom, the stores downtown.

You had to do a\nlot more research with its- we had encyclopedias that we would do our research papers on, you know,\nso it was very different. Because that's not to say, I think it's better now, though, with computers that\nyou can look up and do research with websites and such.

It couldn't be an accredited museum because it wasn't up to code.\nAnd it was just impossible monetarily to change it. It was such a I guess an overwhelming task to do\nthat. The end the second choice was to move everything out and relocate in the hemisphere plaza area\nin another location, or don't rebuild a whole new place. So I think it'll, it'll, time will tell if they keep if they\nmake it really great. Like it was even better or keep the out back buildings, locate them somewhere as\nwell. It can be really great. So we'll see. We'll see how it plays out."

And uh by the time I got into\nmy early 40s, I had finished printing all of them. And there was a lot of them like 75-80 8 by 10,\nnegatives. And I, later on, I thought, what can I do with these, they're beautiful, and I thought I need to\nshow them.

One time we tied a\nrope to a limb of a cypress tree and would swing out wide over the swimming hole and drop into the\nwater. I pretend to be Tarzan swinging on a vine. The spring. I'd fly in the spring at fly kites and on\nsummer nights we'd watch fireflies, but we call them lightning bugs. Every once in a while we'd have\nfights with corn cobs or pine cones. In the winter we'd build a fire in the fireplace and pop popcorn and\nroast peanuts and pecans. I guess I was a live wire. When I was 19 I went to work in Dallas at a\nFirestone Firestone Tire store. I didn't like city life. And for a long time I go home every chance I got.\nmama would always cook my favorite foods. fried okra, Hoppin'John, that's rice and black eyed peas and pecan pie. We had lots of good times, but going home is not the same now. After daddy and mom after daddy died and mom sold the farm and moved to Tyler. I'd rather be living on a farm right now instead of here in the city. But my wife and kids don't understand me when I gripe about city life and\ntalk about moving to the country. My oldest child says Daddy, that's crazy. I just die if I had to live on a\nfarm. I almost cried the first time she said that. I know Texas is changing, but I try to make sure we\ndon't lose touch with our roots. While we may live in a city, I want my kids to have a good feeling for the\nland.

They\nuse these recordings as samples of people standard way of speaking as they try to track how speech in\nTexas varies and changes over time. Would you be willing to read a brief passage on that?"

And when I was\nfive, we moved to a farm near White House, which is southeast of Tyler. I liked growing up in the\ncountry. When my chores were done, I'd ride my horse, climb trees or hike down to the creek to fish or\nswim. One time we tied a rope to a limb of a cypress tree, and we'd swing out wide over the swimming\nhole and drop into the water. I pretend to be Tarzan swinging on a vine. In the spring I'd fly kites and on\nsummer nights we catch fireflies, but we called them lightning bugs. Once in a while we'd have fights\nwith corn cobs or pine cones. In the winter we [OUTSIDE DOOR OPENS] build fire in the fireplace and\npop popcorn and roast peanuts and pecans. [OUTSIDE INAUDIBLE TALKING] I guess I was a live\nwire. When I was 19 I went to work in Dallas at a Firestone Tire store. I didn't like city life and for a long\ntime I go home every chance I got. [OUTSIDE INAUDIBLE TALKING] Mama would always cook my\nfavorite foods. Fried okra, [OUTSIDE INAUDIBLE TALKING] hoppin john, that's rice and black-eyed\npeas, and pecan pie. We had lots of good times, [OUTSIDE INAUDIBLE TALKING] but going home is\nnot the [OUTSIDE INAUDIBLE TALKING] same now. After daddy died, Momma has sold the farm and\nmoved to Tyler. [OUTSIDE INAUDIBLE TALKING] I'd rather be living on a farm right now instead of\nhere the city, but my wife and kids don't understand me when I gripe about city life and talk about\nmoving to the country. [OUTSIDE INAUDIBLE TALKING] My oldest child says, Daddy, that's crazy. I'd\njust died if I had to live on a farm. I almost cried the first time she said that. [OUTSIDE INAUDIBLE\nTALKING] I know Texas is- is changing. [OUTSIDE INAUDIBLE TALKING] But I've tried to make sure\nwe don't lose touch with our roots. While we may live in a city, I want my kids to have a good feeling for\nthe land. Have a sense of place and take pride in being Texans.

And so I\nstarted volunteering, through mainly chartered with a rotary club, I got involved in a nonprofit,\nessentially just the Rotary Club, which is vocational leaders, but really, it's all about giving back. And so\nwe used to have at that time uh it was the rotary Special Olympics. And so it was at [COMMUNITY\nHIGH SCHOOL], and just started volunteering there. And did that for as long as we have that almost 15\nyears. And so it changed a little bit on that side. And Special Olympics changed how we did it for\nqualifying meets and so we don't have it anymore. And I really use it because it was a great community\nthat- but that's where it started was just volunteering a couple hours there. And then it grew into people\nstarted asking myself and others, I want to make sure that this is more about an entire peer group and it\nis myself and just started seeing those out and hey, you got some time, can you come help me with\nthis? And that's how it started. "

As part of this project, a linguistic researcher is asking that interview\nparticipants read a brief passage, which should only take a couple of minutes. It's a short made up\nstory about a life in Texas that was created in the 1980s and since then, linguistic researchers have\nrecorded a few 100 Texans reading it. They now use these recordings as samples of people standard\nway of speaking as they try to track how speech in Texas varies and changes over time. Would you be\nwilling to read this brief passage out loud?"

And when I was five, we moved to a farm near White House, which is in southeast- which is southeast of Tyler. I like growing up in the country. When my chores were done, I'd ride my horse contries or hike down to the creek to fish or swim. One time we try we tied a rope to a limb on a cypress tree, and we'd swing out wide over the swing bowl and drop into the water. I'd pretend to be Tarzan swinging on the vine. In the springtime, I'd like to fly kites and on summer nights we'd catch fireflies, but we call them lightning bugs. Once in a while. We'd have fights with corn cobs or pine cones. In the winter, we build a fire in the fireplace and pop popcorn and roast peanuts and pecans. I guess I was a live wire. When I was 19 I went to work in Dallas at a Firestone Tire store. I didn't like city life and for a long time I'd go home every chance I got. Mama would always cook my favorite foods: fried okra, Uppin John, that's rice with black eyed peas, and pecan pie. We had lots of good times, but going home is not the same now. After daddy died and Mama sold the farm and moved to Tyler. I'd rather be living on a farm right now instead of in the city. But my wife and kids don't understand when I gripe about the city life talk about moving to the country. My oldest child says Daddy, that's crazy, I just die if I had to live on a farm. I almost cried the first time she said that. I know Texas is changing but I'm trying to make sure we don't lose touch with our roots. While we may live in a city I want my kids to have a good- good feeling for the land, have a sense of place, and take pride in being Texan. If they- if we lose our ties to the land, the price of progress is too high"

I mean, it's, I think it's always been like a mini San Francisco or LA, Even back in the 70s, even though, I was-, I wasn't here that. But I remember the 80s. And the 1980s,\nyou know, some of the aspects of what I learned about, like, you know, some of these big cities like\nSan Francisco, LA, that stuff was happening here, too. I remember, in the 80s, when I was a teenager, I\nmean, I didn't, I didn't understand the broader context of what was going on in California and other\nplaces. But I remember what's happening here. And I look back, and I can kind of correlate, you know,\nconnect the dots, what was happening, and, uh, it's not limited here, a little bit there. And\n[COMMUNITY NAME] shares, shares traits with other big cities. And so but, uh, but aside from that,\nthe thing about [COMMUNITY NAME] was 40 years ago, it was more safer and more laidback\nenvironment [CLAP]. That's why I put it."

Um, I think when I was very young, I was, I was subjected to being trapped in the vehicle\nwith my parents, they love to listen to their country music, and smoke a lot of cigarettes. So I'd be\ntrapped in a car with cigarette smoke and country music. So that might have made me biased against\ncountry music, I don't know. But in the 90s definitely electronica took off. John Digweed made his\ndebut, uh, I guess show in 94. Uh, a lot of other artists, some of them started out in like the late 80s like\nMobie.

In the spring, I'd fly kites and on summer nights we'd catch fireflies but we call\nthem lightning bugs. Once in a while we'd have fights with the corn, with corn cobs or pine cones. In the\nwinter we'd build a fire in the fireplace and popcorn and roast peanuts and pecans. I guess I was a live\nwire. When I was 19 I went to work in Dallas at a Firestone Tire store. I didn't like city life and for a long\ntime I'd go home every chance I got. Mama would always cook my favorite foods: fried okra. hoppin\njohn, that's rice and black eyed peas, and pecan pie.

I know Texas is changing.\nBut I try to make sure we don't lose touch with our roots. While we may live in a city, I want my kids to\nhave a good feeling of the land.

I just have one last request for you before we conclude our interview. One of the overarching research questions through the Home to Texas program is about linguistic changes in Texas [ADJUSTS PHONE]. As a part of this project, a linguistic re-researcher is asking the interview [HESITATES] participants to read a brief passage, which should only take about a couple of minutes. It's a short made up story about how life in Texas-that was created in the 1980s. And since then, linguistic researchers have recorded a few 100 Texans reading it. They use these recordings as samples of people's [HESITATES] standard way of speaking as they try to track how speech in Texas varies and changes over time. Would you be willing to read a [HESITATES] brief passage out loud? "

And when I was five, we moved to a farm near White House, which is southeast of Tyler. I liked growin' up in the country. When my chores were done, I'd ride-ride my horse, climb trees, and hike down to the creek to fish or swim. One time we tied a rope to a limb of a cypress tree, and we'd swing out wide over the swimming hole and drop into the water. I'd pretend to be Tarzan swingin' on a vine. In the spring I'd fly kites and on the summer nights we'd catch fireflies, but we called 'em lightnin' bugs. Once in a while we [HESITATES] have fights with corn cobs and pine cones. [SNIFFS] In the winter, we'd build a fire in the fireplace and pop popcorn and roast peanuts and pecans. I guess I was a live wire. When I was 19, I went to work in Dallas at a Firestone Tire store. I didn't like the city life, and for a long time I'd go home every chance I got. Uh, mama would always cook my favorite foods; fried okra, hoppin john, (that's rice and black eyed peas), and a pecan pie. We had a lot of good times, but goin' home, is not the same now. After daddy died, Mama sold the farm [PAUSES] and moved to Tyler. I'd rather be living on the farm right now instead of here in the city, but my wife and kids don't understand me when I gripe about the city life and talk about movin' to the country. My oldest child says \"Daddy, that's crazy. I'd just die if I had to live on a farm.\" I almost cried the first time she said that, and I know ch-Texas is changing. But I tr-try to make sure we don't lose touch with our roots. While we may live in a city, I want my kids to have a good cun-feeling for the land and have a sense of place, uh t-and take pride in being Texas. Uh, if they lose our ties to the land, the price of progress is too high. [SLIDES OVER PAPER] "

Even though, uh, I guess from a corporate standpoint, regardless of what city the company is, in that that they want to keep a presence uh or a connection to the community to some degree. Um, a lot of that is either through uh corporate sponsorship, um, whether it's of uh, one of the um, one of the uhh, sponsorship of like uhh, well one case is the [BASEBALL STADIUM NAME] in [DIFFERENT CENTRAL TEXAS REGION COMMUNITY NAME] in which [COMPANY NAME] uh sponsors, uh, the [CENTRAL TEXAS REGION BASEBALL TEAM NAME].

A third reason may have also been the popularity of MTV for which MTV was still a full medium just for music. Um, so, I think there might have been both the technology and socio-business way that things put an emphasis on on music through the 80's. But I also could uh understand that that's bias, due to my age."

If you have the time, I just have one last request for you before we conclude our interview. One of the overarching research questions about the Home to Texas pro program is about linguistic changes in Texas. As part of this program, a linguistic researcher is asking that interview participants read a brief passage, which should only take a couple of minutes. It's a short made up story about life in Texas that was created in the 1980s and since then, linguistic researchers have recorded a few 100 Texans reading it. They use these recordings as samples of people standard way of speaking as they try to track how speech in Texas varies and changes over time. Would you be willing to read a brief passage out loud?"

I liked growing up in the country. When my chores were done, I'd ride my horse, climb trees and hike down to the creek to fish or swim. One time we tied a rope to a limb of a cypress tree, and we swing out wide over the swimming hole and drop into the water. I pretended to be Tarzan swinging on a vine. In the spring I'd fly kites and on the summer nights we'd catch fireflies, but we'd call them lightning bugs. Once in a while we'd have [STUTTER] fights with corn cobs or pine cones. In the winter, we'd build a fire in the fireplace and pop popcorn and roast peanuts and pecans. I guess I was a Livewire. When I was 19, I went to work in Dallas at the Firestone Tire store. I didn't like city life, and for a long time I'd go home every chance I got. Mama would always cook my favorite foods, [INAUDIBLE NAME OF FOOD], Hoppin' John, that's rice and black eyed peas, and pecan pie. We had lots of good times, but [STUTTER] but going home is not the same now. After daddy died, Mama sold the farm and move to Tyler. I'd rather be living on a farm right now instead of here in the city, but my wife and kids don't understand me when I gripe about city life and talk about moving to the country. My oldest child says \"Daddy, that's crazy, I'd just die if I had to live on a farm.\" I almost cried the first time she said that. I know Texas is changing, but I try to make sure we don't lose touch with our roots. While we may live in the city, I want my kids to have a good feeling for the land, have a sense of place, and take pride in being Texans. If they lose our ties to the land, the price of progress is too high. Thank you for contributing your voice to the collection.

Uh, then the chamber kind of ,uh, transformed in recent years, probably about, uh, a\ndecade ago, uh, that, uh, live here, work here. Okay, so instead of being a commuter, uh, city, where\npeople would go someplace to work, the, the thought process was to develop jobs live here, work here,\nplay here. And so that's what, uh, it has transformed into, uh, also. Uh, uh, even as much as a grocery\nstore. Uh, I can remember where every new HEB was one was at [COMMUNITY SHOPPING\nCENTER], okay,[CENTRAL REGION CITY COMMUNITY CENTER], then [ANOTHER NEIGHBORING\nCITY] got an HEB and, uh, then even as far out of [CENTRAL COMMUNITY REGION CITY NAME]\nstart growing out to [CENTRAL TEXAS REGION'S CITY AREA LOCATION] was the safe way. And so\nit was a big deal when HEB finally came to [COMMUNITY NAME] that we can actually shop here for\nour groceries. And of course, uh, uh Walmart was the, uh on, [COMMUNITY AREA LOCATION] was kind of the, um, magnet that then transformed where we started getting other, uh corporate, um, entities\nlike, you know, eventually we would get Target, Home Depot, Best Buy and those things. So now you\ncan actually shop here. Uh, so you can live here, your work, shop here, play here, and you can do\neverything within [COMMUNITY NAME]."

And so that was again, bringing different\npeople together. We didn't know each other, but we walked together and we sang together.

We have the school district, the big field, which could\nbe a community gathering place to have um, not as not a secular, uh, or- or specific religion, but have\nan event where, um, people could know what the different groups are, uh, showcased the different\ncultures, whatever, those kinds of things, but it takes, it takes resources, both, uh, human resources to\nplan it, and monetary resources to fund it.

So, I relate to all generations\nand and feel comfortable talking about. As a school board trustee that goes beyond just the city\nbecause the school district is like 96 square miles, as opposed to the city, which itself, the city has\n80,000. But people and the school district probably has somewhere between 250 300,000 now. Okay, so, uh, trying to be a listen to the stakeholders, whether their parents or their business people or thier\nthe teachers, the workforce, uh, what-what's happening, who's coming to town? uh, that's important, I\nthink, for the school to know that. But, uh, uh, again, from the workforce thing, it's-it's changing\nsignificantly. Because, again, as I, uh, said, with the volunteers, another component was the school\nwas the core, everybody went to school activities. That's how [COMMUNITY NAME]'s name was\npromoted throughout the state and our students going nationally to competitions, they would know\nwhere [COMMUNITY NAME] is, okay. Now, uh, and we used to be a fast growth district, you know,\nfrom one high school to four high schools,uh, we now have 35, 36 campuses. But what's happening is\nnow, uh, with there's a changing paradigm on public education, and, um, so that is a, uh, wha, uh,\nbeyond our control, and we have charter schools that are coming in. And so that is again, separating\ncommunity, because when we were the only district, people within their neighborhoods would go to that\nschool, be in the PTO, go to the Little League games, um, you know, etc. And know one another and\ndo whatever. And when you have the charter schools are, uh, there's not that many private schools,\nthere's a few, but the homeschooling then that house, you have a different groups and they don't\ninterconnect, so that we're losing that unity. And again, one of the strengths of our community has\nbeen, uh, a good school system academically and with extracurricular activities, because we've always\npromoted, uh, excellence in whatever we do. So our students, whether they're in debate are if they are\nin athletics, or fine arts span, uh, theater of whatever they're doing, even from elementary school to\nspelling bee, you know, they do and they excel, and we need to, uh, amplify that and, uh, let our\ncommunity know that good things are happening."

And so everybody\nhas different priorities. But for me, uh, again, because [BACKGROUND CONSTRUCTION NOISE] of\nmy journey, um, I realized that the basic education we have to teach the four core things of history,\nscience, english and math, and uh, the extracurricular activities are important, but they're not the major\nthing. They help you develop, but how many people are going to pursue playing the trumpet for the rest\nof their life, or their part in the musical or um, their captain of the football team, or tennis, those are so\nvaluable because I did the same thing in high school, I was, um, on a basketball team varsity from ninth\nto 12th grade. And so it develops the character and the discipline and responsibility. If I would love to\nsee a policy where every child in secondary school has to belong to something, whether it's a club, or\nan activity of some sort, because it's what's beyond the academics. But if we falter on the academics,\nthen shame on us, we have not done what we need to do for that child, even though the child doesn't\nwant to do it. And even though the parents might say, This is too hard, you have to stretch. And that's\nthe I don't know, I think that's the important thing.

That means like kickstart, or we have to cut, um, um tutorials\nor things. So it's putting a lot of responsibility onto parents to step up. And for the student to be\nresponsible, and to work harder. Um, And we've um, advocated, we've gone to the state capitol, to our\nlegislators to talk about how, um, funding is so important. Uh, because again, with the pandemic, uh, in\nthe mindset of, uh, I would, I would say it's the pandemic, but it could be the mindset of different cultures too, I don't know that I haven't investigated, but it's like, oh, \"I don't feel like going to school\ntoday. So therefore, I'm gonna stay at home.\" Or \"I have one little trickle and, you know, I'm kind of\ncold, I can't go,\" okay. When they don't go we don't get money. So that means we have to cut programs\nare even and it's across the board. It's not just people always focus on the economically disadvantaged\nor certain groups. This is across the board with your middle class and people who do have money.\nThey'll say, \"Oh, well, we can take our kids out of school today and go on vacation, because they're\nsmart enough they're gonna catch up anyways.\" Well, that's good for them, but it's impacting what we\ncan do, and that's, um, that's probably the biggest challenge. The other thing, uh, other than money that\nis happening right now is so many, uh, the workforce, teachers are leaving teaching. And, um, when I\nlike to talk to people, as you're investigating and doing research, we don't really know exactly why. But\nthe more you talk and get an exit interview, it's not the salary. It's the student discipline, and the parents\nthat are just, uh giving, you know, they can't teach, they're more like babysitters. And it's, it's, we've got,\nI don't know how we swing that back, you know, uh because it's, but thankfully, you know, we have the\nstudents who will excel and the supportive parents who do make it happen. And it's a team, I always\ncall it like a tripod, it used to be called a milk stool, three prongs, you have, you have the school, the\nstudent and the parent, and if they can all be, again, united are on the same page working towards the\nsame goal rolling together, then you're going to have success. But if you lose one of those pegs to that\nchair, you know, and there's a lot of mental illness that's going on right now. And part of that, again, is\num, uh the family unit, uh, the supportive thing with extended, whether it's your religious community\nsupporting you, or our community, again, at large, you know, we've talked about, you know, the\nnetworking, you know, when you have aunts and uncles, or you have neighbors, or you have a a group\nof friends, but if they're on a certain channel, you know, think tank you, you lose some synergy and\nenergy,"

Okay. Uh, obviously roads\nand transportation because roads used to go by property lines, and they were narrow, and the farmers\ncould take their equipment on the roads, and manage. What's happened now as the farmers have been\npushed out, there are no farmers around anymore. Okay, there's just, they can't even move their\nequipment on the road. Uh-uh, I think we talked about the, um, uh-uh the number of shops here used to\nthere was not that you would have the town of party years ago, it had, um, probably three, they called\nthem beer joints or saloons, okay, places, and then you have the post office and you had the bank. And\nthen you had, um, that was about maybe a hairdresser. So anything that you wanted to purchase\nbeyond that, uh in the first big, the Circle C see was the first one, not a Circle K. But it's where the uh\n[COMMUNITY STREET NAME], that was a big thing when it came because that was the first\nconvenience store. So it was open nearly all hours. Uh, another thing that happened was in downtown\n[COMMUNTIY NAME], the current Shell Station kind of across from the fire department, when that\ncame in, it was attrusive, it was just so big with all the lights, I can remember when that was the first\nsignal light, right there, you know, red, green, or whatever it because there were no lights so, uh, and\nthe change is today, if you try to drive by HEB with [COMMUNTIY STREET NAME] and [COMMUNITY\nSTREET NAME] , the new design, people get so confused, there's have been some wreck. So\ntransportation has changed, and our shopping has changed. Uh, and, again, um-uh, knowing people,\nyou know who make the decisions and just knowing people, it's it's, uh it that's changed significantly.\nThey have the neighborhood night out, which started probably again, uh, as the town grew in the last\nprobably 20 years. And so at least neighborhoods attempt to get together, but I don't in the, you know,\nour police forces expanded significantly, because with more growth comes more investigations and\nsecurity is important and crimes. You know, uh, we've had several big crimes that were you know,\n[COMMUNITY NAME] for I'll never, it was like a black eye, you know, like the bomber, or if you\nremember that about three years ago, the bomber actually lived in [COMMUNITY NAME], when he you\nknow that they, they were they couldn't figure out who was doing all of that. And it was like crazy. You\nknow that? Nobody knew that that could even happen here. Nobody knew the person. And he had\nbeen in the barber shop here and live close to the [COMMUNITY CLUB]"

I wanted a place to raise my children. Okay. And so\nwhen I looked at the farmland, and I looked at the community, that family feeling, and the good school\nsystem, and easy transportation, my husband would commute to [CENTRAL TEXAS REGION\nCOMMUNITY] to work, but then I could work here. So it was a destination for families. If I were a young\nfamily today, and we're looking at [COMMUNITY NAME], I would have to question I would have to\nponder, you know, are those schools what I want is their unity and community and the availability of the\nthings that I need. [BACKGROUND CONSTRUCTION NOISE] Because what I'm seeing now is people\nwho have lived here for a while, if they can sell their property, they're moving to the outside, uh, smaller\ncommunities, because that was the kind of life that they had desired. Another big change, I will say, and\nthis is global now, okay, it's not just community. But [COMMUNITY NAME] was, uh, my- my [CHAIR\nSOUND] ancestors were the [COMMUNITY ANCESTOR NAME]. Okay. So they came from\n[EUROPEAN COUNTRY NAME] emigrated, didn't know the language didn't know the call the-the to\nraise crops [BACKGROUND CONSTRUCTION NOISE] that they became farmers. And so the [COMMUNITY PRAIRE], everybody who goes through Texas schools has to take Texas geography and I think middle school I don't know if you did that in seventh or eighth grade, you had to take."

All of the groups I had to take care of you got up in the morning, you had chores, you had to milk\nthe cow. In the afternoon, you had to gather the eggs. Uh, and then in the wintertime, you, um, you\nbutchered your uh pigs or your beef because that was your food, you didn't go to the grocery store to\nget, you bake your bread. Okay, so when we had, going to church, going to school was a big deal. That\nwas important, because that's when we got to see other children and play with other children. So that\nwas really good. Uh, and then with my own children for their childhood, I wanted them to again, be\ninvolved in things. So they were in Four H, and FFA Future Farmers of America. So they they raised like uh, a steer our a lamb, our chickens, uh etc. We didn't do pigs because I did pigs, and I didn't want to do pigs again. So that and then like for us, uh, to read books, even. We didn't have a library in [COMMUNITY NAME]. So the bookmobile from [CENTRAL TEXAS REGION CITY NAME] came about\nonce a month, and we could check out books, it would stop. We knew what time it was coming, and it\nwould stop and we would go and get our books and check them out. And that's how we would read and\nthat was, that was a big deal."

So I liked, I liked all of the decades, uh the 20s to 30s because I didn't live\ndown but I played the music. Uh, as far as listening. I still, uh, I was an Elvis Presley, 60s that's, I think\nwhat you hear in high school becomes what you identify with. Okay. And so, uh, but again, um, I I've\nembraced modern music, um, whether, uh, usually it goes more by a group or, uh an individual like,\nokay, I-I in Willie Nelson or Johnny Cash or Kenny Rogers or whether it's some of the Beatles songs or\nNeil Diamond, uh, so I-I think across the generic on that, um-um but I'm definitely not, um, not not a\nrapper are, you know, I don't know, if you do line dancing. You know, that's kind of that's kind of a\ngroup thing, um, yeah, I. And I definitely have a problem with, [THINKS] songs are written music is\nwritten, depending upon the writer having experienced, uh, like, a lot of country western songs used to\nbe DIVO or CE, you know, or lost love, you know, they've had something's gone wrong. So that's, that's\nhow they work through it. It's a therapy, and they write the songs. But when the songs get to be, again,\nvulgar, and not the right use of words, it goes back to my core values of respect and a while some\nlanguages now they accept words that have implications. Um, I just, it's part of our culture. And it's part\nof their culture, but it doesn't have to be me."

As part of this project, a linguistic researcher is asking that interview participants read a brief\npassage, which should only take a couple of minutes in it is a short made up story about life in Texas,\nthat was created in the 1980s. And since then, linguistic researchers have recorded a few 100 Texans\nreading it. They use these recordings as samples of people's standard way of speaking as they tried to\ntrack how speech in Texas varies and changes over time. Would you be willing to read a brief passage\nout loud? Yes. Great. Thank you so much. And whenever you are ready, [FLIPPING PAPER] could you\nplease read this page out loud?"

I like growing up in the country. When my chores were\ndone, I'd ride my horse, climb trees, or hike down to the creek to fish or swim. [COUGHS] One time we\ntied a rope to a limb of the cypress tree and we'd swing out wide over the swimming hole and drop into\nthe water. I prefer to be Tarzan swinging on a vine.[COUGHS AND DRINKS WATER] In the spring, I'd\nfly kites and on summer nights we'd catch fireflies, but we call them lightning bugs. Once in a while\nwe'd have flights with corn cobs and or pine cones. In the winter, we'd build a fire in the fireplace and\npop popcorn and roast peanuts and pecans. I guess I was alive while when I was 19 I went to work in Dallas at a Firestone Tire store. I didn't like city life and for a long time I'd go home every chance I got, mama would always cook our favorite foods fried okra, hop and John. That's rice and black eyed peas in pecan pie. We had lots of good times, but going home is not the same now. After daddy died, Mama\nsold the farm and moved to Tyler. I'd rather be living on a farm right now instead of hearing the city, but\nmy wife and kids don't understand me when I gripe about city life and talk about moving to the country.\nMy oldest child says daddy, \" That's crazy. I just die if I had to live on a farm.\" I almost cried the first\ntime she said that. I know Texas is changing. But I try to make sure we don't lose touch with our roots.\nWhile we may live in a city, I want my kids to have a good feeling for the lamb. Have a sense of place\nand take pride in being Texans. If they lose our ties to the land, the price of progress is too high."

Also UIL we went to\nCamp spent uh a week there. And I feel like when you go away with, um with people, not just vacations\nbut camps and stuff, you do form a different relationship with them, you get to know them on a different\nlevel. I'm trying to think of what else have done in this. I mean, you know, when you live somewhere in\nthe same place for so long, you're kind of involved in a lot of different things. um And I love this town.\nAnd I and I uh think you know, one of the things at Christmas we have um we usually have a Parade\nand a Festival and I've been involved in it on many different levels. um Also, uh my daughter was\nJamboree Queen and I've pulled the float representing Smithville for a year. um So just a lot of things\nlike that."

I did my student teaching here in [COMMUNITY NAME], in second\ngrade, and then I got married and started having children, and I wanted to be home with my kids. So I\ndid not go to work. I stayed home for five years. And then when I decided to go to work, there was a job\nopening at the high school, and not in second grade. So I took the test, um to be certified to teach\nEnglish. And I taught English for a year. And the grading at night was just extremely time consuming\nwith little children. And so then I went back and took the test to be a home economics teacher. And I did\nthat for a couple of years. And I enjoyed that. But um we did a lot of competitions, which also pulled me\naway from my family. And um so I was just having lunch one day with a coach and talking about how\noverwhelming all the um competitions and, and classroom grading and that kind of thing was for me at\nthat point in my life with young kids. And he said, I think you should be a librarian. I think it's the best\njob in the school. And I literally said, Do you even have to have a certification to be a librarian? And he\nsaid, Yeah, I think you have to have your master's degree. So when I got back to school, after lunch, I\ncalled TEA, and they um had this window, this one year window, where you could test out um to get\ncertified to be a librarian. So I signed up that day for the test, and took it, you know, a few weeks later,\nand got my certification. And the librarian at the time, had been there for 120 years, and had no plan on\nretiring. So I continued to teach home economics the rest of that year. And then she changed her mind\nfor some reason at the end of the year and decided she wasn't going to come back. So I uh took that\njob. And it was actually an elementary at [COMMUNITY ELEMENTARY SCHOOL NAME], which is our\nelementary age level. And I worked there for a year and absolutely loved it and then the high school\nposition opened. And I almost did not take it because I loved the little kids so much. um But I did decide\nto take it and I've been there ever since."

And so I I try to keep that in mind.\nAlso, as I'm doing book orders. um And, and I try to uh break down, you know, our demographics and\nand what we need. For instance, I probably had five books that were books that were in Spanish um\nfive years ago. And now I probably have 200, because we have kids that are bilingual that are, you\nknow, more and more coming to our school. So uh I try to meet the needs of all the kids. um So, so\nthat's part of my job. That's part of my day, I also do um coach UIL during the day. And I spend a lot of\nmy time preparing for that. um Picking pieces for prose and poetry. um And just setting the time aside\ntime to find things that I feel like will benefit for kids for all the different events that I teach. um That's\nprobably takes up as much of my time as doing library work, because it's I teach eight different events.\nAnd so um just finding the right program, for some of them like spelling, it took a couple of years to find\nthe program that I thought would best benefit the kids. um So there's uh so that that takes up part of my\nday. Also, I also do odd jobs, like I do copies for teachers that are in a bind, I I've done lesson plans for\nour home economics and English teachers when we had didn't have um permanent teachers, and we\nwere doing long term sets, they've asked me to do lesson plans. um I've also done lesson plans for a\nhistory class for one semester. um And when I was teaching I, I did a a distance learning German\nclass, which was all uh technology related stuff. So they have also added technology in as part of my\num job description. um I'm I'm are since last year, we have not had four um certified librarians, we've\nhad subs in the librarian positions, and paraprofessionals. And so I'm also in charge of doing all the\nbook ordering for those uh paraprofessionals while they're there. um And I think this is also becoming\ngoing to be my part of my permanent job because I think that's the decision the school board is going\nwith is to have paras in those positions. So I order for them. um I I meet with all of the librarians every\ntwo months. And we go over our goals and what what we need to do to make the library improve the\nlibrary, um which usually includes weeding the library this year, we weeded 40 boxes out of the library.\num That's not typical, but that just is what happened this year. um I've also when others um teachers\nare going back to school to be librarians I have been their supervisor so that they can get their\ncertification. And that requires 180 hours of doing service and monitored service and, and writing\nwriting up, you know what all they do and need to do and that kind of thing. So um I mean, it's hard to\nsay, you know, really what I do [CHUCKLES] in a day because it does change so much. um There's a\nlot of times that there are classes in the library, and and I try to meet their nee needs. My job has\nchanged so much through the years. um You know, when I first started we would do I would work with\nthe English teachers. And we would they would come to the library once a week and we would do a\nlesson together and we would actually co teach and so like if I was going to do a lesson on um\nbibliographies or our lesson on citation, let's say citation, I would take it at that time we had newspapers, I would take a newspaper and lay it out and we would teach how to do a citation at that\nstation. And then we would do a citation on a reference book a citation on fiction a citation on\nnonfiction, and we would just go through rotate through stations, and I would go with the, a the teacher\nwould take some of the stations, I would take the others, and we would just do a rotation of teaching\nthat. Now kids don't even probably do lessons on citations, because they just plug it in. And the\ncomputer does it for him. So um our that role has changed through the years, I do almost no t\ncoteaching anymore. um So I would say primarily, my job right now is the all the fun stuff, which is\nfinding great books and getting kids to read be interested in reading great books."

Mine was\nvacuuming the house and dusting the house. And as we got older, the chores increased. And then as I\nbecame a parent, I realized how important that kind of those small things are. And so I had my kids had\nchores, also. And my oldest child was always very good about getting her chores done at the beginning\nof the week, and checking that off the list and being done with it. And my middle child usually put hers\noff till the end of the week. And uh her one of her chores was to vacuum. And she was very good at it.\nAnd so one day she had been vacuuming for a long time in her bedroom. So I went in to check and the\nvacuum cleaner was running, and she was laying on her bed reading her book. [CHUCKLES] So I don't\nknow [LAUGHS] how many times that happened, but I have a feeling that was kind of how she ran her\nchores. [CHUCKLES] So in your experience, what was the worst chore? I mean, I hated dusting,\nbecause it was so time consuming. And you had to move every little trinket off of the table to dust\nunderneath it and dust that and it was pointless to me. I saw no value in dusting. The next week, it\nlooked the same and it just uh and even now it's probably my least favorite thing to do. I want to do\nthings where I can see a result. I don't like clutter. And so I try to keep things picked up and clutter free.\nThat's more important to me the organizational aspect of cleaning is more important to me than you\nknow, getting dust off furniture."

I I mean, now probably more than I listen, majority of the time to\nsoft rock. But I also like contemporary Christian music, which my husband hates. He likes old school,\ntraditional hymns. He's old school and classic in everything he does. So we kind of differ on that. But\num I like some bluegrass um in little spurts. I can't, not for a long period of time. But uh Johnny Rivers.\num I liked old country. And that's probably because it reminds me of my childhood, because that's what\nmy parents listened to. So I think sometimes music is tied to memories. And that's what makes you like\nit or not like it. And I grew up watching Elvis Presley concerts with my parents, and they both loved him.\nSo I think that's part of why I love him. um My middle child was born on his birthday. And I don't know,\nthere's just that's just kind of a cool thing. And, um you know, my grandparents listened to old country.\nSo that is important to me. Because when I hear certain songs, it reminds me of them. um My dad\nloved uh meatloaf. And so I love meatloaf. I mean, I think that I think a lot of my um childhood\nmemories are tied to music and my dad played the piano and uh a lot of instruments guitar, he was\nvery musically inclined. So music was important to him. And because of that, you know, I like a lot of\nthe things that he liked. uh Just reminds me of happy things."

And when I was five, we moved to a farm near White House, which is southeast of Tyler. I liked growing up in the country. When my chores were done. I'd ride my\nhorse, climb trees or hike down to the creek to fish or swim. One time we tied a rope to a limb of a\ncypress tree, and would swing out what out wide over the swimming hole and drop into the water I\npretended to be Tarzan swinging on a vine. In the spring I'd fly kites and on summer nights we'd catch\nfireflies we called them lightning bugs. Once in a while we'd have fights with corn cobs and pine cones.\nAnd the winner we'd build a fire in the fireplace and pop popcorn and roast peanuts and pecans. I\nguess I was a live wire. When I was 19 I went to work to in Dallas at a Firestone Tire store. I didn't like\ncity life for a long time I'd I'd go home. Every chance I got mama would always cook my favorite foods\nfried okra hoppin John's. That's the rice that's that's rice and black black eyed peas and pecan pie. We\nhad a lot of good times, but going home is not the same now. After daddy died mom sold the farm and\nmoved to Tyler. I'd rather be living on a farm right now instead of here in the city. But my wife and kids\ndon't understand me. When I gripe about city life and talk about moving to the country. My oldest child\nsays, Daddy, that's crazy. I'd just die if I had to live on a farm. I almost cried the first time she said that I\nknow Texas has is changing. But I try to make sure we don't lose touch of our roots. While we may live\nin a city, I want my kids to have a good feeling for the land have a sense of place and take pride in\nbeing Texans. If they lose, if we lose our ties to the land, the price of progress is too high"

So they needed to relocate me. I ended up I was in school with two guys that went to K u. And I decided, I'm going to move to Kansas because they had an opening there. So I relocated from New York to Kansas, met my future business partner in Kansas. And he was already planning on moving to Austin when he graduated. So we connected and this was over no time for social. This is actually for a private weather forecasting company that I started. So at 2425 I picked up. And then, basically, Austin Round Rock. I was in Austin for a little bit, but they had basically been in Round Rock for the last 25, almost 30 years. Gotcha."

I, I it was appealing to me just because it wasn't, I worked in downtown Austin, but wasn't really feeling moving into like the city when I worked down there. So I ended up relocating up here, right after I moved into into Austin and ended up having a business, my business in the Round Rock community. So I think the things that appealed to me was it was a small town when I moved here, so they were probably 30,000 people. And it just seemed like it had everything that I really was looking for as far as like the parks and like I like to fish. So I would come out to Old Settlers Park which by the way, I'm within walking distance now. So I can walk out my front yard and walk across the street and be at the park. So that's always fun. You know, at the time, I wasn't really looking at like school districts and stuff just because I wasn't married, didn't have kids, I was young. But you know, I had a duplex and then I moved into a house over by Stoney Point High School. So it was a it was a brand new community moved in got to know my neighbors and just felt really, really good about being in Round Rock and decided, hey, this is where I'm going to stay. So I think just the appeal of just the small town at the time, obviously now we're growing and growing a lot faster than probably a lot of people want. But I already knew that was coming because I follow the politics a lot. So I already knew Hey, Round Rock is going to be 220,000 people at some point.

You probably have people from 2530 Different countries like literally all mingling together. Everybody's got you know, their own different things they do. But the diversity I think, to me has been one of the things that I think is a highlight of having different cultures and different people here. So my son plays basketball, for instance, and both of his good buddies and basketball in fact, they just came back a few minutes ago from their camp at Stoney point. Both of his buddies are both from India. So one of the kids is from Northern India the other day Kids from southern India are good friends with both of their dads now."

And I realized that, you know, it takes a lot of planning, and I don't envy, you know, the I know, the Director of Transportation, and so a lot of the, you know, city council members, so I realize they have a big challenge ahead of them. I do feel like some of the pre planning and planning may not be as forward looking as possible. So I'll give you an example. You know, as I mentioned, when I moved here, I would, you know, I attend city council, and I would sort of see some of the things that are going on in the community. And there's always been this push of like, Hey, we're going to build out Round Rock until there's houses and park space and business, right. So you can almost expect all usable land at some point to become used. When you think about that, though, the road planning needs to be done with anticipation of, we may need to widen these roads. So there was a huge project that happened on University Boulevard, right? So they built University Boulevard. And it took him five years to just basically relocate the utilities for a two mile stretch to widen the road. If you already know you're going to be widening a road at some point in time in the future, why not just start the utilities. In the end, I again, I may be completely off here. I don't know anything about utilities, but I know that it took a hell of a long time to relocate those utilities. So I almost feel like it's not done on purpose. But you know, if you don't relocate the utilities at some point, you need to hire somebody which keeps people busy. It's still if you built all the utilities far out, so you could just extend the road later. Nobody would have a job to relocate the utilities. I don't know it's just a weird like, thing that kind of goes through my head as I as I observe things, but"

So our typical client would be a roofing company, because that's the world that I lived in before when I was when I owned my Weather Company. However, we do work with some nonprofits throughout the area. producing content and also running ads. My typical day is wake up, look at all the alerts for all the various clients we have get into my planning schedule for the day, do I have any sales calls I need to make? Do I have any follow up I need to make, obviously dealing with issues if there's any particular issues with Facebook, or the ads account I need to deal with. We do have a team meeting at 245. Every day, we're mainly remote. So we meet up every day at 245. To go over the day. We use Google meet a lot. So we're constantly Google meet Google Chat, within within the Google platform. But that would be my main day is just focused all on client work and sales calls. And then I've got some administrative stuff I need to do I oversee almost the whole company. So and then we're small, we're just a three person agency. So whether it's processing client payments, dealing with any of that would be my day in and day out. Community wise, I'm on the board of the YMCA. So I actually just had a meeting with them this morning. And I'm also on the board of directors for the ramrod chamber similar to Jessica Jessica is the president of the board. So I've been on the board now for like six years now. And just contribute as much as I can. I'm on the entrepreneurship Committee, which I've been on for a while Jessica has been on that before and has actually headed that up before. So I do a lot of stuff having to do with entrepreneurship, help run 1 Million Cups, which is an event we have, try to attend all the entrepreneurship related events for the chamber and just be as involved as I can."

So when I when I left my weather company, and I did that for various reasons, but I departed my weather company like around October 2011. And it was a shock to a lot of people because I had 1000s of connections in the roofing industry. And when you have that many people that are following you on Facebook, and you know you're managing a page on Facebook running ads just come full on connected. That that turns into something. So what it turned into was a bunch of roofers reaching out to me saying, Hey, Bill, I've got no time for this social media stuff. I didn't even have a company name until I heard that 100 times. Right. So then I named the company no time for social. And all of those connections led me into immediately started my company and beginning to connect with people and say, Okay, you're a roofer, you're an Arkansas, you need help. Here's what we charge, let's go locally here, same type of thing, right. So I've run several campaigns for city council members and for school board members on Facebook for when they're running for office. So obviously, that connection with the various city council members, the mayor, different people I'm connected with lead to Oh, Bill runs a digital marketing agency that runs Facebook, let me put you in touch with him. So my name being out there has certainly helped with I know a person he could help you. I usually I'm very good at speaking with people. And I'm very try to be as helpful as I can. So I just had a chamber member reach out and he needs help with Google ads. So I'm gonna meet with him on Monday in downtown Round Rock, sit down, go through, you know, whatever I can do to help him. A little bit of goodwill goes a long way. So I do sometimes, obviously, I tried to charge for my time when I can, but I usually will speak with anybody and give him an hour of my time just to sort of help out and I feel like that has come full circle so many times. So that's that's basically how my connections in the in the city have worked."

Well, that's a good feeling, because they may not have the wherewithal or the infrastructure to go out and build, run and manage these ads. Because the Facebook Ads Manager is a mess, and I cannot stand it, but I live in it. And I've been doing it for 10 years. So we're good at it, right. So when you're good at something, even if you don't like it, you can bring value to other people by helping them out. And that's really where I find the most kind of joy from the business side of things is seeing the success of what we do transpire into that business. So and that happens not only locally here, but even with our clients throughout the United States. I mentioned roofing, we generate leads for roofers and sometimes hand over fist for like a third of what they would pay on Google. So that that actually is really cool to see where they're getting, you know, a $20,000 roofing job for a $50 lead. So that's, that's really where the most joy comes from."

So their AI picked up on it, and just immediately banned the page. We've been working, trying to work with Facebook for one month on like, with like five different tickets open, and there's no way to get them to fix it. And no one really cares. And I think when you don't care, it's a big problem. And, you know, I'm not saying they don't care that the page is down, but there's not enough care to get the resolution come to the table with you know, any sense of urgency. You know, it's a major bank, and their page has been down for a month and the bank is their hands are tied. So if that happens to my company, or any of my other businesses that I'm working with, I don't I my sense of I guess my my feeling is that I will not get the support. So I'm losing a little bit of faith in that. So I it is what it is. I mean, like I said, we've been doing this for 10 years, and I hope I can continue running ads for clients for the next five to six years until I get closer to retirement. But you know, the cards are stacked against us right now, unfortunately. So that's really the biggest challenges in our day, everything else seems to be running smoothly. Obviously getting new clients is always a challenge. And you know, Jessica and I have talked about that over the years. Right? As much as possible.

I feel like that time period like the late 70s, when a lot of the one hit wonders came out and there was experimentation with and I used to DJ, by the way. So in New York. So I very familiar with tons of different kinds of music, right. And we didn't have any country in New York when I grew up. So I had no idea what country was until I moved to Kansas. But you know, the electronic music like Herbie Hancock and all the hip hop that came out in Long Island, New York and the Bronx, like, I feel like that timeframe, there was so much experimentation to like, go from rock and roll with the 70s and disco into like, all this kind of music. I feel like it just it changed music. I think the 80s did. And then I feel like the 90s was was good. But it's sort of leveled out a little bit. And there was maybe level less one hit wonders going on, and have these like one off songs that were really exciting. And so that's my opinion on music."

And then I had to be able to get to know the kids. And when\nyou and, you build those relationships with them. And I was fortunate because some kids I had for four\nyears, how many years I have you, two years {interviewer said mhm}. So we build relationships, and\nmy president, and same thing out here, he put a plan together, and you work that plan. And you stay\nwith that plan, and you can tweak it.

And I and I said, let me work with them live and in person. And I'll give you my retirement in\nthe school year.

I said, Okay,\nlet me rephrase {interviewee moved in chair} that. I'm going to retire. And I would appreciate it if I could\ngo out to spring on a pot with enjoyment, enjoying it, and to enjoy the last semester {interviewee tap the\ntable} I'm here, after all these years have given of giving, get up get the online people out of my room.\nAnd he did.

When my chores were done, I'd ride my horse, climb trees or hike down to the\ncreek, quick, to fish or swim. One time we tied a rope to the limb of a cypress tree, and we'd swing out\nwide over the swimming hole and drop into the water. I'd pretend to be Tarzan swinging on the vine. In\nthe Spring, I'd fly kites and on Summer nights we'd catch fireflies, which we called them lightning bugs.\nOnce in a while, we had fights with corn cobs or pine cones. In the Winter we build a fire in the fireplace\nand pop popcorn and roast peanuts and pecans. I guess I was live wire"

I know Texas is changing, but I tried to make sure they, excuse me, I have tried to\nmake sure we don't lose touch with our roots.

Other weaknesses I think are probably just would in a more personal way would be activities here. It is a college town so most everything that people try to open up and do gets taken over by the college kids so there's not like an adult type of activity or things to do here much. Um. Usually if I'm going to do anything, I'd go South because that gives me more options. Um. And that's just kind of a personal thing.

Um so you get to visit a couple of the prison units, um then you actually go into other types of industry, like the glass company, the lumber company, wastewater plant, I just, you really get to see all the behind the scenes pieces that make [COMMUNITY NAME] what it is really. Um the leadership portion of it, I think, I expressed in our board meeting that, you know, I thought that we could do a little bit, a little bit of, a little bit more of the leadership piece, because I believe when you become a leader, you deal with a lot of different things. It's great to have these community connections, you definitely need them as a leader. But I do think that learning how to deal with management and teams of people and different personalities, and then applying your own skill set to be able to manage those people is super, super important.

And um you got a lot of community involvement there, in trying to get community support, community guidance. Trying to build up and provide a service to the veteran students that were on campus. Um. We were one of the first universities to get a VA counselor on site and she's still there today. And that was, that was really special to us, because she could serve our students, but she could also serve the community if someone wanted to visit with her about things. And she did something completely different from school, you know, she was helping them with hospitals and medical visit, counseling services and trying to to guide them through that. Um. When we started that we were in the era of combat veterans coming in. And so transitioning them to uh civilian life and to to higher ED and, and trying to make them feel included, not different, was a little bit of a challenge. And I don't know that I would say we ever perfected it, because I think people come back with experiences that you can't even imagine when they're in combat. So I hope that we helped it some, I wouldn't say that we fixed anything necessarily. We just gave them a little place to fall if they needed to fall. Um. So I had a lot of community involvement there with veteran members of the community. Um. In my role as an Associate Vice President, um it was a little bit more limited. Um. You know, the higher up you go, it seems like the less you really have a lot of people contact, but um the departments underneath me still relied on community for support. I mean, the financial aid department goes out to the high school every day. So we have a connection there with the superintendent and the counselors at the high school on every day they go and do the FAFSA out there. And that was the department that reported to me. Um. Other than that, I can't really think of any tie community ties, um registrar's office was another office that reported to me, which not a lot of community effort there, there wasn't I mean, we're registering students, and we dealt with their parents, but that, they could be in the community, they could be out of the community. Um. And we didn't do any type of fundraising or anything like that. With the chamber, I've had a lot more of that and that's been one of my most favorite things about being here is being immersed into the community, because didn't really get that too much at [TEXAS UNIVERSITY NAME]. You know, and now I've got connections with presidents of banks and companies, large companies, small business owners, just there's so many connections that I've made here. And that's been the most fun part of this job. "

Explain to them how the chamber could benefit them should they want to join, and just kind of help them through. So that's like probably the main thing. I also have people that come to me from across the street, which is a senior living community. They come over often, and they might just need a copy of something. Or maybe they need something notarized and we handle those kinds of things in here as well. Um. But mostly, it's a greater.

It's, it's what I think is what we have to do. As community members, we have to help each other out. And so it's just it's important to me to have that connection and not lose it. Um. Which I think happens easily when you retire especially because you just don't don't do it, you know? And so this this kind of forces me to say, hey you know, I'm here and I'm ready to help you and whatever. I've volunteered for things that I probably would never have volunteered for prior to being a chamber person. Um. So yeah, those things are important to me.

I mean, I was playing baseball in the front yard with the boys and riding skateboards and building ramps for bicycles and jumping, you know, and tire swings, and she was more baby dolls and imaginary friends and hanging out in her bedroom. I spent the night every every chance I got to go somewhere else. I was doing it. And she hardly ever spent the night anywhere. She was always at home. Um. So it wasn't like I had a best friend in her necessarily. Um. She was also really, really tiny. And so I always felt a need to to take up for her. So if we got in trouble. I usually tried to take the brunt of the trouble that we got into. Um. I was very protective of her, even though there wasn't like a really strong strong bond between us and maybe that's just something siblings do. I don't know. But um it was nice to have her. I wouldn't say that, you know, she was my best friend or anything just because we were just so different.

I liked growing up in the country. When my chores were done, I'd ride my horse, climb trees, or hike down to the creek to fish or swim. One time we tied a rope to a limb of a cypress tree, and we'd swing out wide over the swimming hole and drop into the water. I'd pretend to be Tarzan swinging on the vine. In the spring, I'd fly kites and on summer nights we catch fireflies, but we'd called them lightning bugs. Once in a while we'd have fights with the corn cobs or pine cones. In the winter, we'd build a fire in the fireplace and pop popcorn and roast peanuts and pecans. I guess I was a Livewire. When I was 19, I went to work in Dallas at a Firestone Firestone Tire store. I didn't like city life and for a long time I'd go home every chance I got. Mama would always cook my favorite foods, fried okra, hopping John, that's rice and black eyed peas and pecan pie. We had lots of good times, but going home is not the same now. After daddy died, Mama sold the farm and moved to Tyler. I'd rather be living on a farm right now instead of here in the city. But my wife and kids don't understand, understand me when I gripe about city live and talk about moving to the country. My oldest child says daddy that's crazy. I'd just die if I had to live on a farm. I almost cried the first time she said that. I know Texas is changing, but I try to make sure we don't lose touch with our roots. While we may live in a city, I want my kids to have a good feeling for the land have a sense of place and take pride in being Texans. If they lose our ties to the land, the price of progress is too high.  "

I liked growing up in the country, when my chores were done,\nI'd ride my horse, climb trees or hike to the down to the creek to fish or swim. One time we tied a rope\nto a limb of a cypress tree, and it would swing out wide over the swimming hole and drop into the water.\nI'd pretend to be Tarzan swinging on the vine. In the spring, I'd fly kites and on summer nights we'd\ncatch fireflies, but we call them lightning bugs. That's true. Once in a while we'd have fights with corn\ncobs or pine cones. In the winter we'd build a fire in the fireplace and pop popcorn and roast peanuts\nand pecans. I guess I was a Livewire. When I was 19, I went to work in Dallas at a Firestone Tire store.\nI didn't like city life and for a long time I'd go home every chance I got. Mama would always cook my\nfavorite foods fried okra. hoppin john that's rice and black eyed peas in pecan pie. We had lots of good\ntimes, but going home is not the same now. After daddy died, Mama sold the farm and moved to Tyler.\nI'd rather be living on the farm right now instead of here in the city, but my wife and kids don't\nunderstand me. When I gripe about the city life and talk about moving to the country. My oldest child\nsays Daddy, that's crazy. I just die if I had to live on a farm. I almost cried the first time she said that. I\nknow Texas is changing, but I tried to make sure we don't lose touch with our roots. While we may live\nin a city, I want my kids to have a good feeling for the land. Have a sense of place and take pride in\nbeing Texans. If they lose our ties to the land, the price of progress is too high."

And when I\nwas five we moved to a farm near White House, which is south east of Ty- Tyler, sorry. I like growing\nup in the country. When my chores were done, I'd ride my horse, climb trees or hike down uh, the creek\nto fish or swim. One time we tied a rope to a limb of the cypress tree we - and we would swing out wide,\nover the swimming hole and drop into the water. I pretend to be Tarzan swinging on the vine. In the\nspring, I fly kites and on summer nights we'd catch fireflies. We would call them lightning bugs. Once in\na while, we would have fights in the corncob or pine cones. In-in-in-in the winter, we'd build to fire in the\nfireplace and pop popcorn and roast peanuts and pecans. I guess I was a live wire. When I was 19, I\nwent to work in Dallas at the- at a Firestone Tire store. I didn't like city life. For a long time, I would go\nhome every chance I got. Mama would always cook my favorite foods, fried okra, hoppin john, that rice\nand the black eyed peas and pecan pie. We had a lot of good times, but going home was not the same\nnow after daddy died. Okay, but going home, it's not the same. Now. After daddy died, Mama sold the\nfarm and moved to Tyler. I rather be living on a farm right now instead of here in the city, but my wife\nand kids don't understand when I gripe about the city life and talk about moving to the country. Uh-uh-\num my oldest child said, \"Daddy, that's crazy. I'd just die if I had to live on a farm.\" I almost cried for the\nfirst time when she said that. I know Texas is changing. But I try to make sure we don't lose in touch\nwith our roots. While we may live in the city, I want my kids to have the good feeling for the land, have a\nsense of place and take pride in being Texans. If we lose our ties to the land, the price of progress is\ntoo high. [PAUSE] Is that exactly my story that I was talking about-"

I have just one last request for you before we conclude our interview. One of the overarching research questions through the home to Texas program is about linguistic changes in Texas. As part of this project, a linguistic researcher is asking that interview participants read a brief passage, which should only take a couple of minutes. It's a short made up story about life in Texas that was created in the 1980s and since then, linguistic researchers have recorded a few 100 Texans reading it. They use these recordings as samples of people's standard way of speaking as they try to track how speech in Texas varies and changes over time. Would you be willing to read a brief passage out loud?  "

When my chores were done, I ride my horse climb trees or hike down to the creek to fish or swim one time we try to walk to a limb on the cypress tree and we swing out wide over the swimming hole and drop into the water. I pretended to be a Tarzan swinging on the vine. In the spring I like I fly kites and on summer nights we catch fireflies but we call them lightning bugs. Once in a while we had fights with corn cobs or pine cones in the winter we build a fire in the fireplace and pop popcorn and roasted peanuts and pecans. I guess I was live wire when I was 19 I went to work in Dallas as a Firestone Tire and I didn't like city life and for a long time I go home chan- every chance I got. Mama would always cook my favorite foods. Fried okra, hoppin John, that's rice and black eyed peas and pecan pie. We had lots of good times but going on to is not the same now. After daddy died, Mama sold the farm and moved to Taylor. I rather be living on a farm right now instead of here in the city. But my wife and kids don't understand me when I whi- gripe about my gripe about city life and talk about moving to the country. My oldest child says Daddy, that's crazy. I'll just die if I had to live in a form. I almost cried the first time she said that. I know Texas is changing but I tried to make sure we don't lose touch with our roots. While we have live in the city. I want my kids to have a good feeling For the land, have a sense of place and make pride in being Texans. If they lose or if we lose our ties to the land. The price of progress is too high. "

And that was\nnot unusual or, um, odd. It just was. And to me, I think that's an incredible, um, blessing of, or one of the great benefits of living in, in [COMMUNITY NAME], specifically. Um, I think the cost of living in [COMMUNITY NAME] has been lower. Now, that comes with some negative sides related to the fact\nthat I think that there's some poverty issues and other things that need- that are being addressed and\nneed to be addressed. So there's the other side of the coin of lower cost of living, um, the other side of\nthat, but I do think it has a lower cost of living. And, um, and I think that's attractive, um, to families who\nare coming here. I think that it, um... I think the town draws families, maybe more so than it even draws,\num, kind of a single population.

And as I dug into that information a little bit what I realized is that in other\nmajor metropolitan areas, oftentimes they're independent cities within that city, so you call it the Dallas\nmetroplex, but really, it's Garland or Mesquite, or you know, all these separate towns. Or in New York\nCity would be The Bronx or Brooklyn or Manhattan specific, those are boroughs, not so much cities. But\n- [PERSON'S NAME], just one sec, I'll be with you - But in [COMMUNITY NAME], it's- it's one city for\nthe most part. And so I think that's why, whereas those - if this makes sense - that, um, Oakland would\nbe considered separate from San Francisco, two different cities, but [COMMUNITY NAME] is one large\nfootprint of one singular city. So there's, um. So that's why I think they hit that data point as being the\nmost, um, economically segregated country - uh, city, major city in the country. I think that's a real\nnegative of our community that there is, um, you can only drive 15 minutes within the same city limits\nand have very different economic experiences. And that's really, I think you see it in, um, free lunch\nprograms, etc. in the school setting. I mean, that would be a place where you would notice it,\nspecifically, the percentage of kids just 10 minutes apart, um. Who the percentage of kids that might be\nin, uh, qualifying for free and reduced lunch on a school campus and just 10 minutes away, or maybe\n15... maybe that's 98%? And over here, just three, and it's just 10, 12 minutes, and... in the same city\nlimits. So. I think that's a negative. For sure. That's interesting. I hadn't heard about that statistic\nbefore. Yeah, might be worth looking into. Yeah, I mean, I'm speaking a little bit about what I a little bit\nknow."

Like, um, I can play a bit of a name game\nwith people who might know me or know someone in my family. And oftentimes what I say is when\nyou've lived in the same spot for 50, now four years, and actually, I've lived in the same property since I\nwas 13. So 40, 43 years, I've lived literally other than, again, dorm rooms and a few apartments. But for\nthe most part, I have lived in the exact same spot for 43 years. And when you do that, um, the world\nstarts circling around you a little bit, right? Um, it- it's not so much that they're circling around me\nbecause of me, um. It's just when you're static, you, um... the connections begin to happen, um. And... I\nthink also being involved in this educational movement that I'm a part of here at this school, this\nparticular kind of K-12 school as well as the ministry I was involved with, um, it's Young Life, in\n[COMMUNITY NAME], there are a lot of relational connections as well, between those - those\ncommunities tend to be sort of small, and, um - small and big.

And we had a couple friends that we trusted and loved and respected who had began to talk about this kind of school. And it resonated the kind of school it was, while it was a new concept in terms- in terms of title, it very much resonated with the kind of education my parents sort of supplemented, while I went to the public school in [COMMUNITY\nNAME]. And so it sounded very attractive and we came here as parents and then after a number of\nyears was asked if I would consider stepping into an employment role in the classroom. And then after\nthat, it's just been meeting needs as they come up. Um, as the- as the school has needed me to do\ndifferent things. I've leaned toward that, even if I'm not necessarily the expert, I've learned on the job."

Like, um, you know, we're not, we're not, I don't have a steady stream of... I mean,\nyou do have a budget. So there is a steady stream. But there's all- in a private environment, there's\nalways a balance between tuition and budget. And so, it's not spreading taxable dollars across, you\nknow, lots of people. And again, I'm not saying that in a public setting, that's not a same stress, I think it\nis because it's many more buildings and many more problems with more funders. But, um, it's the same\npublic or private, that... limited resources. So limited resources is a challenge. Having said that, I know\nthat I'm in a place where,um, it's not as limited as other places. And so, but just being mindful of,\nthere's only this many dollars and everybody wants something bigger or better or fixed or new or\ncleaned, or, I got an email this morning that, uh - we just painted a room and the teacher said, \"It looks\nfantastic. The outside of the door is great, but is the inside of the door getting done?\" And nobody was\nbeing rude or ugly. But it's that like, \"oh, well, not yet. Sorry.\" Um, so I think that's a challenge. I think\nalso, um, there's many, many opinions in a school setting, um, about what's the most important thing,\num, and you've got all the employees, you've got your supervisors, the people who you work with, but\nthen you also have hundreds of parents who have opinions.

I liked growing up in the country. When my chores were done, I'd ride my horse, climb trees, or hike down to the creek to fish or swim. One time we tied a rope to a limb of a cypress tree and would swing out wide over the swimming hole and drop into the water. I'd pretend to be Tarzan swinging on a vine. In the spring I'd fly kites and on summer nights we'd catch fireflies, but we called them lightning bugs. Once in a while we'd have fights with corncobs or pine cones. In the winter we would build a fire in the fireplace and pop popcorn and roast peanuts and pecans. I guess I was a live wire. When I was 19 I went to work in Dallas at a Firestone Tire store. I didn't like city life, and for a long time I'd go home every chance I got. Mama would always cook my favorite foods: fried okra, hopping John - that's rice and black eyed peas - and pecan pie. We had lots of good times, but going home is not the same now. After Daddy died, Mama sold the farm and moved to Tyler. I'd rather be living on a farm right now instead of here in the city, but my wife and kids don't understand me when I gripe about city life and talk about moving to the country. My oldest child says, \"Daddy, that's crazy. I'd just die if I had to live on a farm.\" I almost cried the first time she said that. I know Texas is changing, but I try to make sure we don't lose touch with our roots. While we may live in a city, I want my kids to have a good feeling about the land, have a sense of place and take pride in being Texans. If they lose our ties to the land, the price of progress is too high."

It is currently about 110,000. And that's just in the city of [COMMUNITY NAME]. So obviously, I've seen a huge change because the population has more than doubled. Um, but the growth and diversity of the industry has grown so much. The healthcare industry has really exploded here. And, um, we're in the process of building a new, um, medical school, that medical school just started this year as part of the UT System. So that's going to add additional, um, emphasis on growth in this area, particularly in the health, health care area. But, uh, we're, we're very fortunate. Um, we have oil and gas in this area, we have real estate, we have quite a bit of manufacturing. Um, we have a tourist industry and a large service industry. So we're a pretty diversified economy. And, um, so I've seen a lot of change over the year, not only physically, but, um, just in the way, uh, daily lives and businesses are conducted."

So ours was just, just a little bit different level. So, uh, that's probably it. Um, because we are so close to, uh, the metropolitan areas sometimes we're overshadowed, and stuff in the transportation areas. So for instance, we have a small to medium sized airport. But we can't attract certain airlines to the airport, because we're within so close to the [NORTH TEXAS REGION COMMUNITY NAME] or [LOUISIANA CITY NAME] areas, so that, that's not something we can really change. But, we can just work with to, to try to work those things out better. But those are a couple of things that are, that are weaknesses. [CLEARS THROAT] "

So, uh, in the late 80s, when the oil industry and real estate industry tanked, uh, or went down so bad, a lot of organizations fail, including banks. And so I woke up one day, and I was without a job. And, uh, uh, the bank sent me through an outsourcing program in Dallas, and they did, you know, personality testing, like a lot of places do. And so the test came back, which I've never really taken very seriously and said, you know, the number one thing you got to do is go to work at a chamber of commerce and number two was be a preacher. And I was like, I just almost laughed at it. But I came back because I was a volunteer. I actually was the Vice President of the Chamber as a volunteer then, and, and I told my, um, the head of it, the chamber, at that time, I said, look at my test. Isn't that funny? In the meantime, I went to work for someone else. And then about six months later, the chamber called me and said, we remember that testing, we have a job opening. Would you come to work for us? And I said, well, it's a nonprofit. That's not a real job. That's, that's what I thought then. But I don't really like the job I'm doing right now, so I'll come do that till I find a real job. So I like telling people 35 years later, I'm still looking for that real job [LAUGHS]. Not really. That's, that's how I got to be in this industry. "

Uh, and I still say to this day, uh, and now I'm, I live by myself, children and family's all gone now, and so I still say on Saturdays, they'll say, \"What do you do on Saturday?\" Well, I'll start by doing my Saturday chores.

And it was all, of course, it was always in the heat of the summer so I hated that because it was always so hot, dragging the hoses around. And we had quite a few plots in the cemetery [CHUCKLES]. At that time, it was up to everybody to water their own parts of the cemetery. That doesn't exist anymore. So I doubt that anybody has that chore because most cemeteries are irrigated now [LAUGHS].

One of the overarching research questions through our program is about the linguistic changes in Texas. So as part of this project, a linguistic researcher is asking that interview participants read a brief passage, which should only take a couple of minutes. It's a short made up story about life in Texas that was created in the 1980s. And since then, linguistic researchers have recorded a few hundred Texans reading it and they use these recordings as samples of people's standard way of speaking as a track, as they try to track how Texas, how Texan speech varies and changes over time. Would you be willing to read the brief passage out loud? "

I was born in Titus County, and when, and when I was five, we moved to a farm near Whitehouse, which is southeast of Tyler. I liked growing up in the country. When my chores were done, I'd ride my horse, climb trees, or hike down to the creek to fish or swim. One time we tied a rope to a limb of a cypress tree, and we'd swing out wide over the swimming hole and drop into the water. I'd pretend to be Tarzan swinging on a vine. And in the spring I'd fly kites, and on summer nights we'd catch fireflies—but we called them \"lightening bugs.” Once in a while, we'd have fights with corn cobs or pinecones. In the winter we'd build a fire in the fireplace and pop popcorn and roast peanuts and pecans. I guess that was a live wire. When I was nineteen, I went to work in Dallas at a Firestone tire store. I didn't like city life, and for a long time I'd go home every chance I got. Mama would always cook my favorite foods: fried okra, Hoppin' John—that's rice with black-eyed peas—and pecan pie. We had lots of good times, but going home is not the same now. After Daddy died, Mama sold the farm and moved to Tyler. I'd rather be living on a farm right now instead of here in the city, and my, but my wife and kids don't understand me when I gripe about the city life and talk about moving to the country. My oldest child says, \"Daddy, that's crazy. I'd just die if I had to live on a farm.\" I almost cried the first time she said that. I know Texas is changing, but I try to make sure we don't lose touch with our roots. While we may live in a city, I want my kids to have a good feeling for all the land, and have a, have a sense of place, and take pride in long, pride in being Texans. If they lose our lives, if we lose our ties to the land, the price of progress is too high. Is that the end? "

And\nwhen I graduated, my basketball coach said, \"Hey, you want to work at the outdoor education center?\"\nAnd I was like, \"Sure.\" So, I took that as a job, right out of college, and then I found out I could get a teaching certificate, um, without going to extra school, just by working.

Well, not most of the time, but at the end of my career, because I'm very even-\ntempered. And we had to do this thing called CPI training, which is um, Crisis Prevention Intervention.\nAnd so they were safe holds to hold a kid that's in crisis, so that you wouldn't get hurt, and you wouldn't\nhurt, hurt the kid. Um, and in that training, they say, \"Never go anywhere by yourself with a child.\" Well,\nif you have a violent child, and you have to go across campus, the district is not going to pay to have\ntwo employees to go anywhere, much less stay in a room. You know, it's just not financially feasible to do that. So you couldn't do anything that they told you in training. And then when something did happen, and you did get hurt... Um, like one of the kids threw a chair at the principal, and she had to go to the emergency room. Um. And then it's like, \"Well, why didn't you follow the CPI procedures?\" And,\nand, you know, it sounds bad, but it's like a woman that, that gets raped. You know, like, \"Well, why did\nyou do that? What that caused you to...\" You know, you're doing your job, and you're doing everything\nyou can to be safe, and you get hurt. And then it's your fault. And so, you know, the policies and\nprocedures and their ideas were just ridiculous. But the kids were just amazing. Even if they were\nhurting you in the moment, that wasn't their intent. So you couldn't really get mad at the kid. So. Oh,\nand then coworkers. There's some such bad teachers. It's ridiculous. They hate kids. And they're yelling\nconstantly at the kids. And they're keeping their jobs somehow. I- I don't know. And they're dumb.\nSome teachers are just dumb. And shouldn't be teaching."

It's still not the case, I think still\nwomen are funneled into teaching. And some people that don't know what they're going to do they just\nbecome a teacher, because that's what women do. And that's, a lot of the problem is that they think,\n\"Oh, well, you know, I want to be a mother someday, I like kids, I'll be a teacher.\" And, it's not, you\nknow... And then, the, it's male dominated at the top. And they don't know how to deal with these, the\nwomen issues. So I think, I mean, that sounds horrible and sexist.

But his high school music was foul mouth, rap music, that all the kids at\nhis high school... I don't know if your brother did, but were listening to this foul mouthed, high school\nmusic, like this rap music. And when my son went to the college, he worked at the Harvard radio\nstation, and he was a DJ at two or three in the morning, for an hour, he an hour segment. So of course,\nI'd set my alarm. And I would listen to him and record him on the radio. And the biggest joke would be\nto write down the titles and then when we're having Thanksgiving with his grandmother... Play some of\nhis selections! And they were the foulest, raunchiest, rap music known to the planet. [DOG WALKING\nACROSS FLOOR] So it's very funny. [LAUGHS]"

I liked growing up in the country.\nWhen my chores were done, I'd ride my horse, climb trees or hike down the creek to fish or swim. One\ntime we tied a rope to a limb of a cypress tree and we'd swing out wide over the swimming hole and\ndrop into the water. I pretend to be Tarzan swinging on a vine.\" [LAUGHING] I would do this as a kid. Um. \"In the spring, I'd fly kites and on summer nights we'd catch fireflies, but we called them lightning bugs. Once in a while we'd have fights with corncob or pine cones. In the winter we build a fire in a fireplace and pop popcorn and roast peanuts and pecans. I guess I was a Livewire. When I was 19 I\nwent to work in Dallas at a Firestone Tire store. I didn't like city life. And for a long time I'd go home\nevery chance I got. Mama would always cook my favorite foods fried okra. hoppin john, that's rice and\nblack eyed peas, and pecan pie. We had lots of good times, but going home is not the same now. After\ndaddy died, Mama sold the farm and moved to Tyler. I'd rather be living on a farm right now instead of\nhere in the city. But my wife and kids don't understand me when I gripe about city life and talk about\nmoving to the country. My oldest child says, \"Daddy, that's crazy. I'd just die if I had to live on a farm.\" I\nalmost cried the first time she said that. I know Texas is changing, but I try to make sure we don't lose\ntouch with our roots. While we may live in this, in a city, I want my kids to have a good feeling for the\nland. Have a sense of place and take pride in being Texans. If they lose our ties to the land the price of\nprogress is too high."

I just have one last request before we conclude our interview. One of the overarching research questions through the home to Texas program is about linguistic changes in Texas. As part of the project a linguistic researcher is asking that interview participants read a brief passage, which should only take a couple of minutes. It's a short made up story about life in Texas that was created in the 1980s and since then, linguistic researchers have recorded a few 100 Texans reading it. They use these recordings as samples of peoples standard way of speaking, as they try to track how speech in Texas varies and changes over time. Would you be willing to read a brief packet passage out loud?  "

I liked growing up in the country. When my chores were done, I'd ride my horse, climb trees or hike down to the creek to fish or swim. One time we tied a rope to a limb of a cypress tree and we'd swing out wide over the swimming hole and drop into the water. I'd pretend to be Tarzan swinging on a vine. In the spring, I'd fly kites and on summer nights we'd catch fireflies, but we called them lightning bugs. Once in a while we'd have fights with corn cobs or pine cones. In the winter we'd build a fire in the fireplace and pop popcorn and roast peanuts and pecans. I guess I was a live wire when I was 19. I went to work in Dallas at a Firestone Tire store. I didn't didn't like city life. And for a long time I go home every chance I got. Mama would always cook my favorite foods: fried okra, hoppin' John, that's rice and black eyed peas and pecan pie. We had lots of good times, but going home is not the same, now. After daddy died, Mama sold the farm and moved to Tyler. I'd rather be living on a farm right now instead of here in the city. But my wife and kids don't understand me when I gripe about city life and talk about moving to the country. My oldest child says, \"Daddy, that's crazy. I'd just die if I had to live on a farm.\" I almost cried the first time she said that. I know Texas is changing. But I try to make sure we don't lose touch with our roots. While we may live in a city, I want my kids to have a good feeling for the land, have a sense of place and take pride in being Texans. If they lose our ties to the land, the price of progress is too high.\""
