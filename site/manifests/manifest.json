When my chores were done, I ride my horse climb trees or hike down to the creek to fish or swim one time we try to walk to a limb on the cypress tree and we swing out wide over the swimming hole and drop into the water. I pretended to be a Tarzan swinging on the vine. In the spring I like I fly kites and on summer nights we catch fireflies but we call them lightning bugs. Once in a while we had fights with corn cobs or pine cones in the winter we build a fire in the fireplace and pop popcorn and roasted peanuts and pecans. I guess I was live wire when I was 19 I went to work in Dallas as a Firestone Tire and I didn't like city life and for a long time I go home chan- every chance I got. Mama would always cook my favorite foods. Fried okra, hoppin John, that's rice and black eyed peas and pecan pie. We had lots of good times but going on to is not the same now. After daddy died, Mama sold the farm and moved to Taylor. I rather be living on a farm right now instead of here in the city. But my wife and kids don't understand me when I whi- gripe about my gripe about city life and talk about moving to the country. My oldest child says Daddy, that's crazy.

And then you had a few people in the, uh, little village that were the banker, or\nthe mercantile, or the drugist, which was like a pharmacy. Um, then with the, uh, Chamber of\nCommerce, when- when, things started happening in [CENTRAL TEXAS REGION'S CITY NAME],\n[COMMUNITY NAME] is very close to [CENTRAL TEXAS REGION'S CITY NAME]. So when IRS, the\nUS government, uh, Internal Revenue Service came to [CENTRAL TEXAS REGION'S CITY NAME],\nsome women started working in [CENTRAL TEXAS REGION'S CITY NAME], the [TEXAS\nUNIVERSITY NAME], they would go there to work. And that was when it started evolving into two\nfamilies to support, um, the, um the family.

Uh, then the chamber kind of ,uh, transformed in recent years, probably about, uh, a\ndecade ago, uh, that, uh, live here, work here. Okay, so instead of being a commuter, uh, city, where\npeople would go someplace to work, the, the thought process was to develop jobs live here, work here,\nplay here. And so that's what, uh, it has transformed into, uh, also. Uh, uh, even as much as a grocery\nstore. Uh, I can remember where every new HEB was one was at [COMMUNITY SHOPPING\nCENTER], okay,[CENTRAL REGION CITY COMMUNITY CENTER], then [ANOTHER NEIGHBORING\nCITY] got an HEB and, uh, then even as far out of [CENTRAL COMMUNITY REGION CITY NAME]\nstart growing out to [CENTRAL TEXAS REGION'S CITY AREA LOCATION] was the safe way.

And of course, uh, uh Walmart was the, uh on, [COMMUNITY AREA LOCATION] was kind of the, um, magnet that then transformed where we started getting other, uh corporate, um, entities\nlike, you know, eventually we would get Target, Home Depot, Best Buy and those things.

As a school board trustee that goes beyond just the city\nbecause the school district is like 96 square miles, as opposed to the city, which itself, the city has\n80,000. But people and the school district probably has somewhere between 250 300,000 now. Okay, so, uh, trying to be a listen to the stakeholders, whether their parents or their business people or thier\nthe teachers, the workforce, uh, what-what's happening, who's coming to town? uh, that's important, I\nthink, for the school to know that. But, uh, uh, again, from the workforce thing, it's-it's changing\nsignificantly. Because, again, as I, uh, said, with the volunteers, another component was the school\nwas the core, everybody went to school activities. That's how [COMMUNITY NAME]'s name was\npromoted throughout the state and our students going nationally to competitions, they would know\nwhere [COMMUNITY NAME] is, okay. Now, uh, and we used to be a fast growth district, you know,\nfrom one high school to four high schools,uh, we now have 35, 36 campuses. But what's happening is\nnow, uh, with there's a changing paradigm on public education, and, um, so that is a, uh, wha, uh,\nbeyond our control, and we have charter schools that are coming in. And so that is again, separating\ncommunity, because when we were the only district, people within their neighborhoods would go to that\nschool, be in the PTO, go to the Little League games, um, you know, etc. And know one another and\ndo whatever. And when you have the charter schools are, uh, there's not that many private schools,\nthere's a few, but the homeschooling then that house, you have a different groups and they don't\ninterconnect, so that we're losing that unity. And again, one of the strengths of our community has\nbeen, uh, a good school system academically and with extracurricular activities, because we've always\npromoted, uh, excellence in whatever we do. So our students, whether they're in debate are if they are\nin athletics, or fine arts span, uh, theater of whatever they're doing, even from elementary school to\nspelling bee, you know, they do and they excel, and we need to, uh, amplify that and, uh, let our\ncommunity know that good things are happening.","format":"text/plain","motivation":"commenting"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Participant","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"}],"target":"https://speaktexan.github.io/tx-central/language_pflugerville_am_06062024/canvas/6#t=697,705"},{"@context":"http://www.w3.org/ns/anno.jsonld","type":"Annotation","motivation":["commenting","tagging"],"id":"https://speaktexan.github.io/tx-central/language_pflugerville_am_06062024/canvas/6/page1","body":[{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Mhmm, Absolutely.

That means like kickstart, or we have to cut, um, um tutorials\nor things. So it's putting a lot of responsibility onto parents to step up. And for the student to be\nresponsible, and to work harder. Um, And we've um, advocated, we've gone to the state capitol, to our\nlegislators to talk about how, um, funding is so important. Uh, because again, with the pandemic, uh, in\nthe mindset of, uh, I would, I would say it's the pandemic, but it could be the mindset of different cultures too, I don't know that I haven't investigated, but it's like, oh, \"I don't feel like going to school\ntoday. So therefore, I'm gonna stay at home.\" Or \"I have one little trickle and, you know, I'm kind of\ncold, I can't go,\" okay. When they don't go we don't get money. So that means we have to cut programs\nare even and it's across the board. It's not just people always focus on the economically disadvantaged\nor certain groups. This is across the board with your middle class and people who do have money.\nThey'll say, \"Oh, well, we can take our kids out of school today and go on vacation, because they're\nsmart enough they're gonna catch up anyways.\" Well, that's good for them, but it's impacting what we\ncan do, and that's, um, that's probably the biggest challenge. The other thing, uh, other than money that\nis happening right now is so many, uh, the workforce, teachers are leaving teaching. And, um, when I\nlike to talk to people, as you're investigating and doing research, we don't really know exactly why. But\nthe more you talk and get an exit interview, it's not the salary. It's the student discipline, and the parents\nthat are just, uh giving, you know, they can't teach, they're more like babysitters. And it's, it's, we've got,\nI don't know how we swing that back, you know, uh because it's, but thankfully, you know, we have the\nstudents who will excel and the supportive parents who do make it happen. And it's a team, I always\ncall it like a tripod, it used to be called a milk stool, three prongs, you have, you have the school, the\nstudent and the parent, and if they can all be, again, united are on the same page working towards the\nsame goal rolling together, then you're going to have success. But if you lose one of those pegs to that\nchair, you know, and there's a lot of mental illness that's going on right now. And part of that, again, is\num, uh the family unit, uh, the supportive thing with extended, whether it's your religious community\nsupporting you, or our community, again, at large, you know, we've talked about, you know, the\nnetworking, you know, when you have aunts and uncles, or you have neighbors, or you have a a group\nof friends, but if they're on a certain channel, you know, think tank you, you lose some synergy and\nenergy,","format":"text/plain","motivation":"commenting"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Participant","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"}],"target":"https://speaktexan.github.io/tx-central/language_pflugerville_am_06062024/canvas/6#t=1406,1406"},{"@context":"http://www.w3.org/ns/anno.jsonld","type":"Annotation","motivation":["commenting","tagging"],"id":"https://speaktexan.github.io/tx-central/language_pflugerville_am_06062024/canvas/6/page1","body":[{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Those challenges are very demanding, I must say","format":"text/plain","motivation":"commenting"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Interviewer","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"}],"target":"https://speaktexan.github.io/tx-central/language_pflugerville_am_06062024/canvas/6#t=1406,1429"},{"@context":"http://www.w3.org/ns/anno.jsonld","type":"Annotation","motivation":["commenting","tagging"],"id":"https://speaktexan.github.io/tx-central/language_pflugerville_am_06062024/canvas/6/page1","body":[{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Yes","format":"text/plain","motivation":"commenting"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Participant","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"}],"target":"https://speaktexan.github.io/tx-central/language_pflugerville_am_06062024/canvas/6#t=1430,1433"},{"@context":"http://www.w3.org/ns/anno.jsonld","type":"Annotation","motivation":["commenting","tagging"],"id":"https://speaktexan.github.io/tx-central/language_pflugerville_am_06062024/canvas/6/page1","body":[{"type":"TextualBody","value":"And I never knew how much it takes to run a school.

[CHAIR CREAKING] I was born in Titus County. And when I was five,\nwe moved to a farm near White House, which is southeast of Tyler. I liked growing up in the country.\nWhen my chores were done, I'd ride my horse, climb trees or hike down the creek to fish or swim. One\ntime we tied a rope to a limb of a cypress tree and we'd swing out wide over the swimming hole and\ndrop into the water. I pretend to be Tarzan swinging on a vine.\" [LAUGHING] I would do this as a kid. Um. \"In the spring, I'd fly kites and on summer nights we'd catch fireflies, but we called them lightning bugs. Once in a while we'd have fights with corncob or pine cones. In the winter we build a fire in a fireplace and pop popcorn and roast peanuts and pecans. I guess I was a Livewire. When I was 19 I\nwent to work in Dallas at a Firestone Tire store. I didn't like city life. And for a long time I'd go home\nevery chance I got. Mama would always cook my favorite foods fried okra. hoppin john, that's rice and\nblack eyed peas, and pecan pie. We had lots of good times, but going home is not the same now. After\ndaddy died, Mama sold the farm and moved to Tyler. I'd rather be living on a farm right now instead of\nhere in the city. But my wife and kids don't understand me when I gripe about city life and talk about\nmoving to the country. My oldest child says, \"Daddy, that's crazy. I'd just die if I had to live on a farm.\" I\nalmost cried the first time she said that. I know Texas is changing, but I try to make sure we don't lose\ntouch with our roots. While we may live in this, in a city, I want my kids to have a good feeling for the\nland. Have a sense of place and take pride in being Texans.
