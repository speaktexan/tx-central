Yeah. I think round rock over the years has grown into just a phenomenal community. I, I it was\nappealing to me just because it wasn't, I worked in downtown Austin, but wasn't really feeling moving\ninto like the city when I worked down there. So I ended up relocating up here, right after I moved into\ninto Austin and ended up having a business, my business in the Round Rock community. So I think the\nthings that appealed to me was it was a small town when I moved here, so they were probably 30,000\npeople. And it just seemed like it had everything that I really was looking for as far as like the parks and\nlike I like to fish. So I would come out to Old Settlers Park which by the way, I'm within walking distance\nnow. So I can walk out my front yard and walk across the street and be at the park. So that's always\nfun. You know, at the time, I wasn't really looking at like school districts and stuff just because I wasn't\nmarried, didn't have kids, I was young. But you know, I had a duplex and then I moved into a house\nover by Stoney Point High School. So it was a it was a brand new community moved in got to know my\nneighbors and just felt really, really good about being in Round Rock and decided, hey, this is where\nI'm going to stay. So I think just the appeal of just the small town at the time, obviously now we're\ngrowing and growing a lot faster than probably a lot of people want. But I already knew that was coming\nbecause I follow the politics a lot. So I already knew Hey, Round Rock is going to be 220,000 people at\nsome point.

And I realized that, you know, it takes a lot of planning, and I don't envy, you know, the I\nknow, the Director of Transportation, and so a lot of the, you know, city council members, so I realize they have a big challenge ahead of them. I do feel like some of the pre planning and planning may not be as forward looking as possible. So I'll give you an example. You know, as I mentioned, when I moved here, I would, you know, I attend city council, and I would sort of see some of the things that are\ngoing on in the community. And there's always been this push of like, Hey, we're going to build out Round Rock until there's houses and park space and business, right. So you can almost expect all usable land at some point to become used. When you think about that, though, the road planning needs to be done with anticipation of, we may need to widen these roads. So there was a huge project\nthat happened on University Boulevard, right? So they built University Boulevard. And it took him five years to just basically relocate the utilities for a two mile stretch to widen the road. If you already know you're going to be widening a road at some point in time in the future, why not just start the utilities. In the end, I again, I may be completely off here. I don't know anything about utilities, but I know that it\ntook a hell of a long time to relocate those utilities. So I almost feel like it's not done on purpose. But you know, if you don't relocate the utilities at some point, you need to hire somebody which keeps people busy. It's still if you built all the utilities far out, so you could just extend the road later. Nobody would have a job to relocate the utilities.

I've lived in Texas all my life. I was born in Titus County. And when I was five, we moved to a farm near White House, which is south east of Tyler. I liked growing up in the country. When my chores were done, I'd ride my horse, climb trees and hike down to the creek to fish or swim. One time we tied a rope to a limb of a cypress tree, and we swing out wide over the swimming hole and drop into the water. I pretended to be Tarzan swinging on a vine. In the spring I'd fly kites and on the summer nights we'd catch fireflies, but we'd call them lightning bugs. Once in a while we'd have [STUTTER] fights with corn cobs or pine cones. In the winter, we'd build a fire in the fireplace and pop popcorn and roast peanuts and pecans. I guess I was a Livewire. When I was 19, I went to work in Dallas at the Firestone Tire store. I didn't like city life, and for a long time I'd go home every chance I got. Mama would always cook my favorite foods, [INAUDIBLE NAME OF FOOD], Hoppin' John, that's rice and black eyed peas, and pecan pie. We had lots of good times, but [STUTTER] but going home is not the same now. After daddy died, Mama sold the farm and move to Tyler. I'd rather be living on a farm right now instead of here in the city, but my wife and kids don't understand me when I gripe about city life and talk about moving to the country. My oldest child says \"Daddy, that's crazy, I'd just die if I had to live on a farm.\" I almost cried the first time she said that. I know Texas is changing, but I try to make sure we don't lose touch with our roots. While we may live in the city, I want my kids to have a good feeling for the land, have a sense of place, and take pride in being Texans. If they lose our ties to the land, the price of progress is too high. Thank you for contributing your voice to the collection.

I mean, when my chores were done, I'd ride my horse, climb trees, or hike down the creek to fish\nand swim.

In the spring, I'd\nfly kites and on summer nights, we'd watch fireflies, but we call them lightning bugs. While, uh, once in\na while. [TONGUE SMACKS] We'd have fights with corn cobs and pine cones. In the winter we'd build\na fire in the fireplace and pop popcorn and roast peanuts and pecans. I guess I was a live wire. When I\nwas 19 I went to work in Dallas at Firestone Tire store. I didn't like li- uh, city life and for a long time I'd\ngo home every chance I got. [LAUGHS] Mama would always cook my favorite foods. Fried okra, hoppin\njohn, that's the rice and black eyed peas, and pecan pie. We had lots of good times, but going home is\nnot the same now. After daddy died, Mama sold the farm and moved to Tyler. I'd rather be living on the\nfarm right now instead of here in the city, but my wife and kids don't understand me when I gripe about\ncity life [LAUGHS] and talk about moving to the country. My oldest child says \"Daddy, you're crazy,\" or\n\"that's crazy. I just die if I had to live on a farm.\" [CLEARS THROAT] I almost cried the first time she\nsaid that. I know Texas is changing, but I try to make sure it doesn't lose touch with its roots or with our\nroots.

And as I dug into that information a little bit what I realized is that in other\nmajor metropolitan areas, oftentimes they're independent cities within that city, so you call it the Dallas\nmetroplex, but really, it's Garland or Mesquite, or you know, all these separate towns.

But\n- [PERSON'S NAME], just one sec, I'll be with you - But in [COMMUNITY NAME], it's- it's one city for\nthe most part.

I mean,\nyou do have a budget. So there is a steady stream. But there's all- in a private environment, there's\nalways a balance between tuition and budget.

Sorry.\" Um, so I think that's a challenge. I think\nalso, um, there's many, many opinions in a school setting, um, about what's the most important thing,\num, and you've got all the employees, you've got your supervisors, the people who you work with, but\nthen you also have hundreds of parents who have opinions.

I've lived in Texas all my life. I was born in Titus County. And when I was five, we moved to a farm near White House which is southeast of Tyler. I liked growing up in the country. When my chores were done, I'd ride my horse, climb trees, or hike down to the creek to fish or swim. One time we tied a rope to a limb of a cypress tree and would swing out wide over the swimming hole and drop into the water. I'd pretend to be Tarzan swinging on a vine. In the spring I'd fly kites and on summer nights we'd catch fireflies, but we called them lightning bugs. Once in a while we'd have fights with corncobs or pine cones. In the winter we would build a fire in the fireplace and pop popcorn and roast peanuts and pecans. I guess I was a live wire. When I was 19 I went to work in Dallas at a Firestone Tire store. I didn't like city life, and for a long time I'd go home every chance I got. Mama would always cook my favorite foods: fried okra, hopping John - that's rice and black eyed peas - and pecan pie. We had lots of good times, but going home is not the same now. After Daddy died, Mama sold the farm and moved to Tyler. I'd rather be living on a farm right now instead of here in the city, but my wife and kids don't understand me when I gripe about city life and talk about moving to the country. My oldest child says, \"Daddy, that's crazy. I'd just die if I had to live on a farm.\" I almost cried the first time she said that. I know Texas is changing, but I try to make sure we don't lose touch with our roots. While we may live in a city, I want my kids to have a good feeling about the land, have a sense of place and take pride in being Texans. If they lose our ties to the land, the price of progress is too high.","format":"text/plain","motivation":"commenting"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Participant","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"}],"target":"https://speaktexan.github.io/tx-central/language_san_antonio_en_06212024/canvas/5#t=1740,1837"},{"@context":"http://www.w3.org/ns/anno.jsonld","type":"Annotation","motivation":["commenting","tagging"],"id":"https://speaktexan.github.io/tx-central/language_san_antonio_en_06212024/canvas/5/page1","body":[{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Thank you so much!","format":"text/plain","motivation":"commenting"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Interviewer","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"}],"target":"https://speaktexan.github.io/tx-central/language_san_antonio_en_06212024/canvas/5#t=1838,1838"},{"@context":"http://www.w3.org/ns/anno.jsonld","type":"Annotation","motivation":["commenting","tagging"],"id":"https://speaktexan.github.io/tx-central/language_san_antonio_en_06212024/canvas/5/page1","body":[{"type":"TextualBody","value":"You're welcome!","format":"text/plain","motivation":"commenting"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Participant","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"}],"target":"https://speaktexan.github.io/tx-central/language_san_antonio_en_06212024/canvas/5#t=1839,1839"},{"@context":"http://www.w3.org/ns/anno.jsonld","type":"Annotation","motivation":["commenting","tagging"],"id":"https://speaktexan.github.io/tx-central/language_san_antonio_en_06212024/canvas/5/page1","body":[{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Yeah, that's pretty much it.

And so the test came back, which I've never really taken very seriously and said, you know, the number one thing you got to do is go to work at a chamber of commerce and number two was be a preacher. And I was like, I just almost laughed at it. But I came back because I was a volunteer. I actually was the Vice President of the Chamber as a volunteer then, and, and I told my, um, the head of it, the chamber, at that time, I said, look at my test. Isn't that funny? In the meantime, I went to work for someone else. And then about six months later, the chamber called me and said, we remember that testing, we have a job opening. Would you come to work for us? And I said, well, it's a nonprofit. That's not a real job. That's, that's what I thought then. But I don't really like the job I'm doing right now, so I'll come do that till I find a real job.

I lived in Texas all my life. I was born in, do I read it word for word? I was born in Titus County, and when, and when I was five, we moved to a farm near Whitehouse, which is southeast of Tyler. I liked growing up in the country. When my chores were done, I'd ride my horse, climb trees, or hike down to the creek to fish or swim. One time we tied a rope to a limb of a cypress tree, and we'd swing out wide over the swimming hole and drop into the water. I'd pretend to be Tarzan swinging on a vine. And in the spring I'd fly kites, and on summer nights we'd catch fireflies—but we called them \"lightening bugs.” Once in a while, we'd have fights with corn cobs or pinecones. In the winter we'd build a fire in the fireplace and pop popcorn and roast peanuts and pecans. I guess that was a live wire. When I was nineteen, I went to work in Dallas at a Firestone tire store. I didn't like city life, and for a long time I'd go home every chance I got. Mama would always cook my favorite foods: fried okra, Hoppin' John—that's rice with black-eyed peas—and pecan pie. We had lots of good times, but going home is not the same now. After Daddy died, Mama sold the farm and moved to Tyler. I'd rather be living on a farm right now instead of here in the city, and my, but my wife and kids don't understand me when I gripe about the city life and talk about moving to the country. My oldest child says, \"Daddy, that's crazy. I'd just die if I had to live on a farm.\" I almost cried the first time she said that. I know Texas is changing, but I try to make sure we don't lose touch with our roots. While we may live in a city, I want my kids to have a good feeling for all the land, and have a, have a sense of place, and take pride in long, pride in being Texans. If they lose our lives, if we lose our ties to the land, the price of progress is too high.

It's a short made up story about life in Texas that was created in the 1980s and since then, linguistic researchers have recorded a few 100 Texans reading it.

I pretended to be a Tarzan swinging on the vine. In the spring I like I fly kites and on summer nights we catch fireflies but we call them lightning bugs.

Mama would always cook my favorite foods. Fried okra, hoppin John, that's rice and black eyed peas and pecan pie. We had lots of good times but going on to is not the same now. After daddy died, Mama sold the farm and moved to Taylor. I rather be living on a farm right now instead of here in the city. But my wife and kids don't understand me when I whi- gripe about my gripe about city life and talk about moving to the country. My oldest child says Daddy, that's crazy. I'll just die if I had to live in a form. I almost cried the first time she said that. I know Texas is changing but I tried to make sure we don't lose touch with our roots.

As part of this project, a linguistic researcher is asking that interview\nparticipants read a brief passage, which should only take a couple of minutes.

I've lived in Texas all my life. I was born in Titus County. And when I was five, we moved to a farm near White House, which is in southeast- which is southeast of Tyler. I like growing up in the country. When my chores were done, I'd ride my horse contries or hike down to the creek to fish or swim. One time we try we tied a rope to a limb on a cypress tree, and we'd swing out wide over the swing bowl and drop into the water. I'd pretend to be Tarzan swinging on the vine. In the springtime, I'd like to fly kites and on summer nights we'd catch fireflies, but we call them lightning bugs. Once in a while. We'd have fights with corn cobs or pine cones. In the winter, we build a fire in the fireplace and pop popcorn and roast peanuts and pecans. I guess I was a live wire. When I was 19 I went to work in Dallas at a Firestone Tire store. I didn't like city life and for a long time I'd go home every chance I got. Mama would always cook my favorite foods: fried okra, Uppin John, that's rice with black eyed peas, and pecan pie. We had lots of good times, but going home is not the same now. After daddy died and Mama sold the farm and moved to Tyler. I'd rather be living on a farm right now instead of in the city. But my wife and kids don't understand when I gripe about the city life talk about moving to the country. My oldest child says Daddy, that's crazy, I just die if I had to live on a farm. I almost cried the first time she said that. I know Texas is changing but I'm trying to make sure we don't lose touch with our roots. While we may live in a city I want my kids to have a good- good feeling for the land, have a sense of place, and take pride in being Texan.

I liked growing up in the country, when my chores were done,\nI'd ride my horse, climb trees or hike to the down to the creek to fish or swim. One time we tied a rope\nto a limb of a cypress tree, and it would swing out wide over the swimming hole and drop into the water.\nI'd pretend to be Tarzan swinging on the vine. In the spring, I'd fly kites and on summer nights we'd\ncatch fireflies, but we call them lightning bugs. That's true. Once in a while we'd have fights with corn\ncobs or pine cones. In the winter we'd build a fire in the fireplace and pop popcorn and roast peanuts\nand pecans. I guess I was a Livewire. When I was 19, I went to work in Dallas at a Firestone Tire store.\nI didn't like city life and for a long time I'd go home every chance I got. Mama would always cook my\nfavorite foods fried okra. hoppin john that's rice and black eyed peas in pecan pie. We had lots of good\ntimes, but going home is not the same now. After daddy died, Mama sold the farm and moved to Tyler.\nI'd rather be living on the farm right now instead of here in the city, but my wife and kids don't\nunderstand me. When I gripe about the city life and talk about moving to the country. My oldest child\nsays Daddy, that's crazy. I just die if I had to live on a farm. I almost cried the first time she said that. I\nknow Texas is changing, but I tried to make sure we don't lose touch with our roots. While we may live\nin a city, I want my kids to have a good feeling for the land.

I liked growing up in the country, when my chores were done,\nI'd ride my horse, climb trees or hike to the down to the creek to fish or swim. One time we tied a rope\nto a limb of a cypress tree, and it would swing out wide over the swimming hole and drop into the water.\nI'd pretend to be Tarzan swinging on the vine. In the spring, I'd fly kites and on summer nights we'd\ncatch fireflies, but we call them lightning bugs. That's true. Once in a while we'd have fights with corn\ncobs or pine cones. In the winter we'd build a fire in the fireplace and pop popcorn and roast peanuts\nand pecans. I guess I was a Livewire. When I was 19, I went to work in Dallas at a Firestone Tire store.\nI didn't like city life and for a long time I'd go home every chance I got. Mama would always cook my\nfavorite foods fried okra. hoppin john that's rice and black eyed peas in pecan pie. We had lots of good\ntimes, but going home is not the same now. After daddy died, Mama sold the farm and moved to Tyler.\nI'd rather be living on the farm right now instead of here in the city, but my wife and kids don't\nunderstand me. When I gripe about the city life and talk about moving to the country. My oldest child\nsays Daddy, that's crazy. I just die if I had to live on a farm. I almost cried the first time she said that. I\nknow Texas is changing, but I tried to make sure we don't lose touch with our roots. While we may live\nin a city, I want my kids to have a good feeling for the land.

I was Born in Titus County, and when I was five, we moved to a\nfarm near White House, which is south east of Tyler. I like growing up in the country. When my chores\nwere done, I'd ride my horse, climb trees or hike down to the creek to fish or swim. One time we tied a\nrope to a limb of a cypress tree and would swing out wide over the swimming hole and drop into the\nwater. I pretend to be Tarzan swinging on a vine. The spring. I'd fly in the spring at fly kites and on\nsummer nights we'd watch fireflies, but we call them lightning bugs. Every once in a while we'd have\nfights with corn cobs or pine cones. In the winter we'd build a fire in the fireplace and pop popcorn and\nroast peanuts and pecans. I guess I was a live wire. When I was 19 I went to work in Dallas at a\nFirestone Firestone Tire store. I didn't like city life. And for a long time I go home every chance I got.\nmama would always cook my favorite foods. fried okra, Hoppin'John, that's rice and black eyed peas and pecan pie. We had lots of good times, but going home is not the same now. After daddy and mom after daddy died and mom sold the farm and moved to Tyler. I'd rather be living on a farm right now instead of here in the city. But my wife and kids don't understand me when I gripe about city life and\ntalk about moving to the country. My oldest child says Daddy, that's crazy. I just die if I had to live on a\nfarm. I almost cried the first time she said that. I know Texas is changing, but I try to make sure we\ndon't lose touch with our roots. While we may live in a city, I want my kids to have a good feeling for the\nland.

And then you had a few people in the, uh, little village that were the banker, or\nthe mercantile, or the drugist, which was like a pharmacy. Um, then with the, uh, Chamber of\nCommerce, when- when, things started happening in [CENTRAL TEXAS REGION'S CITY NAME],\n[COMMUNITY NAME] is very close to [CENTRAL TEXAS REGION'S CITY NAME]. So when IRS, the\nUS government, uh, Internal Revenue Service came to [CENTRAL TEXAS REGION'S CITY NAME],\nsome women started working in [CENTRAL TEXAS REGION'S CITY NAME], the [TEXAS\nUNIVERSITY NAME], they would go there to work. And that was when it started evolving into two\nfamilies to support, um, the, um the family. And then when IBM, uh, came on [CENTRAL TEXAS\nREGION'S CITY AREA LOCATION], that was another significant boost for [COMMUNITY NAME]\nbecause it was located on the north side of [CENTRAL TEXAS REGION'S CITY NAME], [\nCONSTRUCTION NOISE] And, uh, uh again, that was a location that, uh, many of the, the women\nwent to work. Uh, then the chamber kind of ,uh, transformed in recent years, probably about, uh, a\ndecade ago, uh, that, uh, live here, work here. Okay, so instead of being a commuter, uh, city, where\npeople would go someplace to work, the, the thought process was to develop jobs live here, work here,\nplay here. And so that's what, uh, it has transformed into, uh, also. Uh, uh, even as much as a grocery\nstore. Uh, I can remember where every new HEB was one was at [COMMUNITY SHOPPING\nCENTER], okay,[CENTRAL REGION CITY COMMUNITY CENTER], then [ANOTHER NEIGHBORING\nCITY] got an HEB and, uh, then even as far out of [CENTRAL COMMUNITY REGION CITY NAME]\nstart growing out to [CENTRAL TEXAS REGION'S CITY AREA LOCATION] was the safe way. And so\nit was a big deal when HEB finally came to [COMMUNITY NAME] that we can actually shop here for\nour groceries. And of course, uh, uh Walmart was the, uh on, [COMMUNITY AREA LOCATION] was kind of the, um, magnet that then transformed where we started getting other, uh corporate, um, entities\nlike, you know, eventually we would get Target, Home Depot, Best Buy and those things.

That means like kickstart, or we have to cut, um, um tutorials\nor things. So it's putting a lot of responsibility onto parents to step up. And for the student to be\nresponsible, and to work harder. Um, And we've um, advocated, we've gone to the state capitol, to our\nlegislators to talk about how, um, funding is so important. Uh, because again, with the pandemic, uh, in\nthe mindset of, uh, I would, I would say it's the pandemic, but it could be the mindset of different cultures too, I don't know that I haven't investigated, but it's like, oh, \"I don't feel like going to school\ntoday. So therefore, I'm gonna stay at home.\" Or \"I have one little trickle and, you know, I'm kind of\ncold, I can't go,\" okay. When they don't go we don't get money. So that means we have to cut programs\nare even and it's across the board. It's not just people always focus on the economically disadvantaged\nor certain groups. This is across the board with your middle class and people who do have money.\nThey'll say, \"Oh, well, we can take our kids out of school today and go on vacation, because they're\nsmart enough they're gonna catch up anyways.\" Well, that's good for them, but it's impacting what we\ncan do, and that's, um, that's probably the biggest challenge. The other thing, uh, other than money that\nis happening right now is so many, uh, the workforce, teachers are leaving teaching. And, um, when I\nlike to talk to people, as you're investigating and doing research, we don't really know exactly why. But\nthe more you talk and get an exit interview, it's not the salary. It's the student discipline, and the parents\nthat are just, uh giving, you know, they can't teach, they're more like babysitters. And it's, it's, we've got,\nI don't know how we swing that back, you know, uh because it's, but thankfully, you know, we have the\nstudents who will excel and the supportive parents who do make it happen. And it's a team, I always\ncall it like a tripod, it used to be called a milk stool, three prongs, you have, you have the school, the\nstudent and the parent, and if they can all be, again, united are on the same page working towards the\nsame goal rolling together, then you're going to have success. But if you lose one of those pegs to that\nchair, you know, and there's a lot of mental illness that's going on right now.

Uh-uh, I think we talked about the, um, uh-uh the number of shops here used to\nthere was not that you would have the town of party years ago, it had, um, probably three, they called\nthem beer joints or saloons, okay, places, and then you have the post office and you had the bank.

So\ntransportation has changed, and our shopping has changed. Uh, and, again, um-uh, knowing people,\nyou know who make the decisions and just knowing people, it's it's, uh it that's changed significantly.\nThey have the neighborhood night out, which started probably again, uh, as the town grew in the last\nprobably 20 years. And so at least neighborhoods attempt to get together, but I don't in the, you know,\nour police forces expanded significantly, because with more growth comes more investigations and\nsecurity is important and crimes. You know, uh, we've had several big crimes that were you know,\n[COMMUNITY NAME] for I'll never, it was like a black eye, you know, like the bomber, or if you\nremember that about three years ago, the bomber actually lived in [COMMUNITY NAME], when he you\nknow that they, they were they couldn't figure out who was doing all of that.

And so, uh, but again, um, I I've\nembraced modern music, um, whether, uh, usually it goes more by a group or, uh an individual like,\nokay, I-I in Willie Nelson or Johnny Cash or Kenny Rogers or whether it's some of the Beatles songs or\nNeil Diamond, uh, so I-I think across the generic on that, um-um but I'm definitely not, um, not not a\nrapper are, you know, I don't know, if you do line dancing. You know, that's kind of that's kind of a\ngroup thing, um, yeah, I. And I definitely have a problem with, [THINKS] songs are written music is\nwritten, depending upon the writer having experienced, uh, like, a lot of country western songs used to\nbe DIVO or CE, you know, or lost love, you know, they've had something's gone wrong. So that's, that's\nhow they work through it. It's a therapy, and they write the songs. But when the songs get to be, again,\nvulgar, and not the right use of words, it goes back to my core values of respect and a while some\nlanguages now they accept words that have implications. Um, I just, it's part of our culture. And it's part\nof their culture, but it doesn't have to be me.","format":"text/plain","motivation":"commenting"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Participant","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"}],"target":"https://speaktexan.github.io/tx-central/language_pflugerville_am_06062024/canvas/14#t=3704,3842"},{"@context":"http://www.w3.org/ns/anno.jsonld","type":"Annotation","motivation":["commenting","tagging"],"id":"https://speaktexan.github.io/tx-central/language_pflugerville_am_06062024/canvas/14/page1","body":[{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Absolutely.

I didn't like city life and for a long time I'd go home every chance I got, mama would always cook our favorite foods fried okra, hop and John. That's rice and black eyed peas in pecan pie. We had lots of good times, but going home is not the same now. After daddy died, Mama\nsold the farm and moved to Tyler.

For instance, you know, I worked with violent kids\nmost of the time. Well, not most of the time, but at the end of my career, because I'm very even-\ntempered. And we had to do this thing called CPI training, which is um, Crisis Prevention Intervention.\nAnd so they were safe holds to hold a kid that's in crisis, so that you wouldn't get hurt, and you wouldn't\nhurt, hurt the kid. Um, and in that training, they say, \"Never go anywhere by yourself with a child.\" Well,\nif you have a violent child, and you have to go across campus, the district is not going to pay to have\ntwo employees to go anywhere, much less stay in a room. You know, it's just not financially feasible to do that. So you couldn't do anything that they told you in training. And then when something did happen, and you did get hurt... Um, like one of the kids threw a chair at the principal, and she had to go to the emergency room. Um. And then it's like, \"Well, why didn't you follow the CPI procedures?\" And,\nand, you know, it sounds bad, but it's like a woman that, that gets raped. You know, like, \"Well, why did\nyou do that? What that caused you to...\" You know, you're doing your job, and you're doing everything\nyou can to be safe, and you get hurt. And then it's your fault. And so, you know, the policies and\nprocedures and their ideas were just ridiculous. But the kids were just amazing. Even if they were\nhurting you in the moment, that wasn't their intent. So you couldn't really get mad at the kid. So. Oh,\nand then coworkers. There's some such bad teachers. It's ridiculous. They hate kids. And they're yelling\nconstantly at the kids.

So work day for me is-- we are a digital marketing agency. A little bit different than hot dog\nmarketing, we focus only on social media, and focus on Google AdWords, but mainly Facebook ads.\nSo our typical client would be a roofing company, because that's the world that I lived in before when I\nwas when I owned my Weather Company. However, we do work with some nonprofits throughout the\narea. producing content and also running ads. My typical day is wake up, look at all the alerts for all the\nvarious clients we have get into my planning schedule for the day, do I have any sales calls I need to\nmake? Do I have any follow up I need to make, obviously dealing with issues if there's any particular\nissues with Facebook, or the ads account I need to deal with. We do have a team meeting at 245.\nEvery day, we're mainly remote. So we meet up every day at 245. To go over the day. We use Google\nmeet a lot. So we're constantly Google meet Google Chat, within within the Google platform. But that\nwould be my main day is just focused all on client work and sales calls. And then I've got some\nadministrative stuff I need to do I oversee almost the whole company. So and then we're small, we're\njust a three person agency. So whether it's processing client payments, dealing with any of that would\nbe my day in and day out. Community wise, I'm on the board of the YMCA. So I actually just had a\nmeeting with them this morning. And I'm also on the board of directors for the ramrod chamber similar\nto Jessica Jessica is the president of the board.

I'm on the entrepreneurship Committee, which I've been on for a\nwhile Jessica has been on that before and has actually headed that up before.

And it was a shock to\na lot of people because I had 1000s of connections in the roofing industry. And when you have that\nmany people that are following you on Facebook, and you know you're managing a page on Facebook\nrunning ads just come full on connected. That that turns into something. So what it turned into was a\nbunch of roofers reaching out to me saying, Hey, Bill, I've got no time for this social media stuff. I didn't\neven have a company name until I heard that 100 times. Right. So then I named the company no time\nfor social. And all of those connections led me into immediately started my company and beginning to\nconnect with people and say, Okay, you're a roofer, you're an Arkansas, you need help. Here's what we\ncharge, let's go locally here, same type of thing, right. So I've run several campaigns for city council\nmembers and for school board members on Facebook for when they're running for office. So obviously,\nthat connection with the various city council members, the mayor, different people I'm connected with\nlead to Oh, Bill runs a digital marketing agency that runs Facebook, let me put you in touch with him. So\nmy name being out there has certainly helped with I know a person he could help you. I usually I'm very\ngood at speaking with people. And I'm very try to be as helpful as I can. So I just had a chamber\nmember reach out and he needs help with Google ads. So I'm gonna meet with him on Monday in\ndowntown Round Rock, sit down, go through, you know, whatever I can do to help him. A little bit of\ngoodwill goes a long way. So I do sometimes, obviously, I tried to charge for my time when I can, but I\nusually will speak with anybody and give him an hour of my time just to sort of help out and I feel like\nthat has come full circle so many times.

Well, that's a good feeling, because they may not have the\nwherewithal or the infrastructure to go out and build, run and manage these ads.

So I signed up that day for the test, and took it, you know, a few weeks later,\nand got my certification. And the librarian at the time, had been there for 120 years, and had no plan on\nretiring.

And so I I try to keep that in mind.\nAlso, as I'm doing book orders. um And, and I try to uh break down, you know, our demographics and\nand what we need. For instance, I probably had five books that were books that were in Spanish um\nfive years ago. And now I probably have 200, because we have kids that are bilingual that are, you\nknow, more and more coming to our school. So uh I try to meet the needs of all the kids. um So, so\nthat's part of my job. That's part of my day, I also do um coach UIL during the day. And I spend a lot of\nmy time preparing for that. um Picking pieces for prose and poetry. um And just setting the time aside\ntime to find things that I feel like will benefit for kids for all the different events that I teach. um That's\nprobably takes up as much of my time as doing library work, because it's I teach eight different events.\nAnd so um just finding the right program, for some of them like spelling, it took a couple of years to find\nthe program that I thought would best benefit the kids. um So there's uh so that that takes up part of my\nday. Also, I also do odd jobs, like I do copies for teachers that are in a bind, I I've done lesson plans for\nour home economics and English teachers when we had didn't have um permanent teachers, and we\nwere doing long term sets, they've asked me to do lesson plans. um I've also done lesson plans for a\nhistory class for one semester. um And when I was teaching I, I did a a distance learning German\nclass, which was all uh technology related stuff. So they have also added technology in as part of my\num job description. um I'm I'm are since last year, we have not had four um certified librarians, we've\nhad subs in the librarian positions, and paraprofessionals. And so I'm also in charge of doing all the\nbook ordering for those uh paraprofessionals while they're there. um And I think this is also becoming\ngoing to be my part of my permanent job because I think that's the decision the school board is going\nwith is to have paras in those positions. So I order for them. um I I meet with all of the librarians every\ntwo months. And we go over our goals and what what we need to do to make the library improve the\nlibrary, um which usually includes weeding the library this year, we weeded 40 boxes out of the library.\num That's not typical, but that just is what happened this year. um I've also when others um teachers\nare going back to school to be librarians I have been their supervisor so that they can get their\ncertification. And that requires 180 hours of doing service and monitored service and, and writing\nwriting up, you know what all they do and need to do and that kind of thing. So um I mean, it's hard to\nsay, you know, really what I do [CHUCKLES] in a day because it does change so much. um There's a\nlot of times that there are classes in the library, and and I try to meet their nee needs. My job has\nchanged so much through the years. um You know, when I first started we would do I would work with\nthe English teachers. And we would they would come to the library once a week and we would do a\nlesson together and we would actually co teach and so like if I was going to do a lesson on um\nbibliographies or our lesson on citation, let's say citation, I would take it at that time we had newspapers, I would take a newspaper and lay it out and we would teach how to do a citation at that\nstation. And then we would do a citation on a reference book a citation on fiction a citation on\nnonfiction, and we would just go through rotate through stations, and I would go with the, a the teacher\nwould take some of the stations, I would take the others, and we would just do a rotation of teaching\nthat. Now kids don't even probably do lessons on citations, because they just plug it in. And the\ncomputer does it for him. So um our that role has changed through the years, I do almost no t\ncoteaching anymore. um So I would say primarily, my job right now is the all the fun stuff, which is\nfinding great books and getting kids to read be interested in reading great books.","format":"text/plain","motivation":"commenting"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Participant","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"}],"target":"https://speaktexan.github.io/tx-central/language_smithville_bs_06252024/canvas/18#t=867,1242"},{"@context":"http://www.w3.org/ns/anno.jsonld","type":"Annotation","motivation":["commenting","tagging"],"id":"https://speaktexan.github.io/tx-central/language_smithville_bs_06252024/canvas/18/page1","body":[{"type":"TextualBody","value":"So what does it mean to be a librarian and UIL coach, all the things you do in this community?","format":"text/plain","motivation":"commenting"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Interviewer","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"}],"target":"https://speaktexan.github.io/tx-central/language_smithville_bs_06252024/canvas/18#t=1243,1250"},{"@context":"http://www.w3.org/ns/anno.jsonld","type":"Annotation","motivation":["commenting","tagging"],"id":"https://speaktexan.github.io/tx-central/language_smithville_bs_06252024/canvas/18/page1","body":[{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Um, well, I mean, I hope that, you know, I love my job.

Okay, reading passage growing up in Texas. I've lived in Texas\nall my life. I was born in Titus County. And when I was five, we moved to a farm near White House, which is southeast of Tyler. I liked growing up in the country. When my chores were done. I'd ride my\nhorse, climb trees or hike down to the creek to fish or swim. One time we tied a rope to a limb of a\ncypress tree, and would swing out what out wide over the swimming hole and drop into the water I\npretended to be Tarzan swinging on a vine. In the spring I'd fly kites and on summer nights we'd catch\nfireflies we called them lightning bugs. Once in a while we'd have fights with corn cobs and pine cones.\nAnd the winner we'd build a fire in the fireplace and pop popcorn and roast peanuts and pecans. I\nguess I was a live wire. When I was 19 I went to work to in Dallas at a Firestone Tire store. I didn't like\ncity life for a long time I'd I'd go home. Every chance I got mama would always cook my favorite foods\nfried okra hoppin John's. That's the rice that's that's rice and black black eyed peas and pecan pie. We\nhad a lot of good times, but going home is not the same now. After daddy died mom sold the farm and\nmoved to Tyler. I'd rather be living on a farm right now instead of here in the city. But my wife and kids\ndon't understand me. When I gripe about city life and talk about moving to the country. My oldest child\nsays, Daddy, that's crazy. I'd just die if I had to live on a farm.
